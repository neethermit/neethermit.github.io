[Mia] Whew, _ \ I'm glad I made it on time.
[Mia] Well, _ I have to say Phoenix, _ \ I'm impressed!
[Mia] Not everyone takes on a \ murder trial right off \ the bat like this.
[Mia] It says a lot about \ you... _ and your client as well.
[Phoenix] Um... thanks.
[Phoenix] Actually, it's because \ I owe him a favor.
[Mia] A favor?
[Mia] You mean, you knew the \ defendant before this case?
[Phoenix] Yes.
[Phoenix] Actually, I kind of owe \ my current job to him.
[Phoenix] He's one of the reasons \ I became an attorney.
[Mia] Well, that's news to me!
[Phoenix] I want to help him out \ any way I can!
[Phoenix] I just... really want to help \ him, I owe him that much.

[Phoenix] Um, _ yeah. *sigh*

[Phoenix] My name is Phoenix Wright.
[Phoenix] Here's the story:
[Phoenix] My first case is \ a fairly simple one.
[Phoenix] A young woman was killed \ in her apartment.
[Phoenix] The guy they arrested was \ the unlucky sap dating her:
[Phoenix] <s> Larry Butz... __ <n> my best \ friend since grade school.
[Phoenix] Our school had a saying: __ \ <s> "When something smells, _ \ it's usually the Butz."
[Phoenix] In the 23 years I've known \ him, it's usually been true.
[Phoenix] He has a knack for getting \ himself in trouble.
[Phoenix] One thing I can say though: __ \ It's usually not his fault. \ He just has terrible luck.
[Phoenix] But I know better than anyone, \ that he's a good guy at heart.
[Phoenix] That and I owe him one. \ Which is why I took the \ case... to clear his name.
[Phoenix] And that's just what I'm \ going to do!

[Judge] Mr. Wright, given the _ \ circumstances...
[Judge] I think we should have a test \ to ascertain your readiness.
[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.
[Phoenix] <s> #blue (Gulp... __ Hands shaking... __ \ Eyesight... __ fading...)
[Judge] This test will consist of a \ few simple questions. Answer \ them clearly and concisely.

{label} defendant_question
[Judge] Please state the name of \ the defendant in this case.
{choice} [Phoenix Wright] defendant_phoenix_wright  [Mia Fey] defendant_mia_fey  [Larry Butz] defendant_larry_butz

{label} defendant_phoenix_wright
[Phoenix] Um... the defendant... \ is me, right?
[Mia] Wright! Have you completely \ lost your mind? Focus!
[Mia] The defendant is the \ person on trial!
[Mia] You're his lawyer!
[Phoenix] Um, er, eh? \ Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
[Mia] This is no laughing matter!
[Mia] You did pass the bar, \ didn't you?
[Judge] Sorry, I couldn't hear your \ answer. I'll ask once more:

{label} defendant_mia_fey
[Phoenix] The, um, defendant? \ That's... er... Mia Fey?
[Mia] Wrong, Wright. \ Look, I have to leave.
[Mia] I have to go home. I'm... \ I'm expecting a delivery.
[Phoenix] Aw, c'mon Chief. \ There's no need to be \ going so soon, is there?
[Mia] Wright!
[Mia] Listen: the defendant is \ the one on trial--your client!
[Mia] I mean, that's about as \ basic as you can get!
[Phoenix] #blue (I've put my foot in it this time! \ I've got to relax!)
[Judge] Sorry, I couldn't hear your \ answer. I'll ask once more:
{goto} defendant_question

{label} defendant_larry_butz
[Phoenix] The defendant? Well, that's \ Larry Butz, Your Honor.
[Judge] Correct.
[Judge] Just keep your wits about \ you and you'll do fine.

[Judge] Next question:
[Judge] This is a murder trial. Tell me, \ what's the victim's name?
[Phoenix] #blue (Whew, I know this one! Glad \ I read the case report cover \ to cover so many times.)
[Phoenix] #blue (It's... wait... Uh-oh!)
[Phoenix] #blue (No... no way! I forgot! \ I'm drawing a total blank \ here!)
[Mia] Phoenix! Are you absolutely \ SURE you're up to this?
[Mia] You don't even know the \ victim's name!?
[Phoenix] Oh, the victim! O-Of course \ I know the victim's name!
[Phoenix] I, um, just forgot. \ ... Temporarily.
[Mia] I think I feel a migraine \ coming on.
[Mia] Look, the defendant's name \ is listed in the Court Record.
[Mia] Just touch the Court Record \ button to check it at anytime, \ okay?
[Mia] Remember to check it often. \ Do it for me, please. \ I'm begging you.

{label} victim_question
[Judge] Let's hear your answer. \ Who is the victim in this case?
{choice} [Mia Fey] victim_mia_fey  [Cinder Block] victim_cinder_block  [Cindy Stone] victim_cindy_stone

{label} victim_mia_fey
[Phoenix] Um... Mia Fey?
[Mia] W-W-What!? How can I be \ the victim!?
[Phoenix] Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, \ it was the first name that \ popped into my head, and--
[Mia] The Court Record button! \ Remember to use it \ when you are in a pinch.
[Judge] Let me ask that one again:
{goto} victim_question

{label} victim_cinder_block
[Phoenix] Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? \ Ms. Cinder Block?
[Judge] The person in question was a \ victim of murder, not ill- \ conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
[Mia] Wright?
[Mia] If you forget something, just \ touch the Court Record button \ to help you remember.
[Mia] A mistake in court \ could cost you the case.
[Judge] I ask you again:
{goto} victim_question

{label} victim_cindy_stone
[Phoenix] Um... the victim's name \ is Cindy Stone.
[Judge] Correct.
[Judge] Now, tell me, what \ was the cause of death?

[Mia] Check the court record. \ The Court Record button... \ remember?
[Phoenix] #blue (Geez. Give a guy a break!)
[Judge] Let me ask again.
{goto} died_question

{label} died_strangled
[Phoenix] Right... she was \ strangled, wasn't she?
[Mia] Please tell me that was \ you talking to yourself.
[Judge] If you wish to hang yourself, \ Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, \ but not inside my courtroom.
[Judge] I suppose there's nothing to \ do but give you another try:
{goto} died_question

{label} dead_hit_with_a_blunt_object
[Phoenix] She was struck once, \ by a blunt object.
[Judge] Correct.

[Judge] You've answered all my \ questions. I see no reason \ why we shouldn't proceed.
[Judge] You seem much more relaxed, \ Mr. Wright. Good for you.
[Phoenix] Thank you, Your Honor. \ #blue (Because I don't FEEL \ relaxed, that's for sure.)
[Judge] Well, then...
[Judge] First, a question for the \ prosecution. Mr. Payne?
[Payne] Yes, Your Honor?
[Judge] As Mr. Wright just told us, \ the victim was struck with \ a blunt object.
[Judge] Would you explain to the court \ just what that "object" was?
[Payne] The murder weapon was this \ statue of "The Thinker."
[Payne] It was found lying on the \ floor, next to the victim.
[Judge] I see... the court accepts \ it into evidence.
[] Statue added to \ the Court Record.
[Mia] Wright...
[Mia] Be sure to pay attention to \ any evidence added during \ the trial.
[Mia] That evidence is the only \ ammunition you have in court.
[Mia] Touch the Court Record \ button to check the Court \ Record frequently.
[Judge] Mr. Payne, the prosecution \ may call its first witness.
[Payne] The prosecution calls the \ defendant, Mr. Butz, to the \ stand.
[Phoenix] Um, Chief, what do I do now?
[Mia] Pay attention. You don't want \ to miss any information that \ might help your client's case.
[Mia] You'll get your chance to \ respond to the prosecution \ later, so be ready!
[Mia] Let's just hope he doesn't \ say anything... unfortunate.
[Phoenix] #blue (Uh oh, Larry gets excited \ easily... this could be bad.)

[] ...

[Payne] Ahem.
[Payne] Mr. Butz. Is it not true that \ the victim had recently \ dumped you?
[Butz] Hey, watch it buddy!
[Butz] We were great together! \ We were Romeo and Juliet, \ Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!
[Phoenix] #blue (Um... didn't they all die?)
[Butz] I wasn't dumped! She just \ wasn't taking my phone calls. \ Or seeing me... Ever.
[Butz] WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?
[Payne] Mr. Butz, what you describe \ is generally what we mean \ by "dumped."
[Payne] In fact, she had completely \ abandoned you... and was \ seeing other men!
[Payne] She had just returned from \ overseas with one of them \ the day before the murder!
[Butz] Whaddya mean, "one of them"!?
[Butz] Lies! All of it, lies! \ I don't believe a word of it!
[Payne] Your Honor, the \ victim's passport.
[Payne] According to this, she was \ in Paris until the day before \ she died.
[] Passport added to \ the Court Record.
[Judge] Hmm... Indeed, she appears \ to have returned the day \ before the murder.
[Butz] Dude... no way...
[Payne] The victim was a model, but \ did not have a large income.
[Payne] It appears that she had \ several "Sugar Daddies."
[Butz] Daddies? \ Sugar?
[Payne] Yes. Older men, who gave \ her money and gifts.
[Payne] She took their money and used \ it to support her lifestyle.
[Butz] Duuude!
[Payne] We can clearly see what kind \ of woman this Ms. Stone was.
[Payne] Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do \ you think of her now?
[Mia] Wright...
[Mia] I don't think you want \ him to answer that question.
[Phoenix] #blue (Yeah... Larry has a way of \ running his mouth in all \ the wrong directions.)

[Phoenix] #blue (Should I...?)
{choice} [Wait and see what happens] wait_and_see  [Stop him from answering] stop_him

{label} wait_and_see
[Phoenix] #blue (Might be better not to \ get involved in this one...)
[Payne] Well, Mr. Butz?
[Butz] Dude, no way! \ That cheatin' she-dog!
{goto} cheating_she_dog

{label} stop_him
[Phoenix] My client had no idea the \ victim was seeing other men!
[Phoenix] That question is \ irrelevant to this case!
[Payne] Oof! *wince*
[Butz] Dude! Nick! \ Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!?
[Butz] That cheatin' she-dog!

{label} cheating_she_dog
[Butz] I'm gonna die. \ I'm just gonna drop dead!
[Butz] Yeah, and when I meet her in \ the afterlife...
[Butz] I'm going to get to the bottom \ of this!
[Judge] Let's continue with the trial, \ shall we?
[Payne] I believe the accused's \ motive is clear to everyone.
[Judge] Yes, quite.
[Phoenix] #blue (Oh boy. This is so not \ looking good.)
[Payne] Next question!
[Payne] You went to the victim's \ apartment on the day of \ the murder, did you not?
[Butz] Gulp!
[Payne] Well, did you, or did you not?
[Butz] Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe \ I did, and maybe I didn't!

[Butz] Er... Yeah! Yeah! \ I was there! I went!
[Judge] Order!
[Judge] Well, Mr. Butz?
[Butz] Dude, chill!
[Butz] She wasn't home, man... \ So, like, I didn't see her.
[Payne] *OBJECTION!*
[Payne] Your Honor, the defendant \ is lying.
[Judge] Lying?
[Payne] The prosecution would like \ to call a witness who can \ prove Mr. Butz is lying.
{goto} witness_prove_larry_didit

[Phoenix] #blue (LIE LIKE A DOG)
[Butz] Um, well, see, it's like this: \ I don't remember.
[Payne] You "don't remember"?
[Payne] Well then, we'll just \ have to remind you!
[Phoenix] #blue (I got a bad feeling \ about this...)
[Payne] We have a witness that can \ prove he DID go to the \ victim's apartment that day!
{goto} witness_prove_larry_didit

{label} witness_prove_larry_didit
[Judge] Well, that simplifies matters. \ Who is your witness?
[Payne] The man who found \ the victim's body.
[Payne] Just before making the \ gruesome discovery...
[Payne] He saw the defendant fleeing \ the scene of the crime!
[Judge] Order! Order in the court!
[Judge] Mr. Payne, the prosecution \ may call its witness.
[Payne] Yes, Your Honor.
[Phoenix] #blue (This is bad...)
[Payne] On the day of the murder, my \ witness was selling newspapers \ at the victim's building.
[Payne] Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit \ to the stand!

[] ...

[Payne] Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper \ subscriptions, is this correct?
[Sahwit] Oh, oh yes! \ Newspapers, yes!
[Judge] Mr. Sahwit, you may \ proceed with your testimony.
[Judge] Please tell the court what \ you saw on the day of the \ murder.

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Witness's Account --
[Sahwit] I was going door-to-door, _ \ selling subscriptions when I saw \ a man fleeing an apartment.
[Sahwit] I thought he must be in a \ hurry because he left the \ door half-open behind him.
[Sahwit] Thinking it strange, _ I looked \ inside the apartment.
[Sahwit] Then I saw her lying there... _ \ A woman... _ not moving... _ dead!
[Sahwit] I quailed in fright and found \ myself unable to go inside.
[Sahwit] I thought to call the police \ immediately!
[Sahwit] However, the phone in her \ apartment wasn't working.
[Sahwit] I went to a nearby park and \ found a public phone.
[Sahwit] I remember the time exactly: _ \ It was 1:00 PM.
[Sahwit] The man who ran was, _ without \ a doubt, _ the defendant sitting \ right over there.

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...
[Phoenix] #blue (Larry! Why didn't you \ tell the truth?)
[Phoenix] #blue (I can't defend you against \ a testimony like that!)
[Judge] Incidentally, why wasn't \ the phone in the victim's \ apartment working?
[Payne] Your Honor, at the time of \ the murder, there was a \ blackout in the building.
[Judge] Aren't phones supposed to \ work during a blackout?
[Payne] Yes, Your Honor...
[Payne] However, some cordless phones \ do not function normally.
[Payne] The phone that Mr. Sahwit \ used was one of those.
[Payne] Your Honor...
[Payne] I have a record of the \ blackout, for your perusal.
[] Blackout Record added \ to the Court Record.
[Judge] Now, Mr. Wright...
[Phoenix] Yes! \ Er... yes, Your Honor?
[Judge] You may begin your \ cross-examination.
[Phoenix] C-Cross-examination, \ Your Honor?
[Mia] Alright, Wright, this is it. \ The real deal!
[Phoenix] Uh... what exactly am I \ supposed to do?
[Mia] Why, you expose the lies in \ the testimony the witness \ just gave!
[Phoenix] Lies! What?! He was lying!?
[Mia] Your client is innocent, \ right?
[Mia] Then that witness must have \ lied in his testimony!
[Mia] Or is your client really... \ guilty?
[Phoenix] !!! How do I prove he's not?
[Mia] You hold the key! \ It's in the evidence!
[Mia] Compare the witness's \ testimony to the \ evidence at hand.
[Mia] There's bound to be a \ contradiction in there!
[Mia] First find contradictions \ between the Court Record \ and the witness's testimony.
[Mia] Then, once you've found the \ contradicting evidence...
[Mia] present it and rub \ it in the witness's face!
[Phoenix] Um... okay.
[Mia] Touch the Court Record button \ and point out contradictions \ in the testimony!

[Sahwit] Terribly sorry about \ the misunderstanding...

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm... I see. \ You heard a voice saying \ the time on a taped program.

[Judge] Mr. Wright, you may cross- \ examine the witness.

[Mia] Wright!

[Mia] You know what to do!

[Phoenix] I've got this one.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- The Time of Discovery --

[Sahwit] (1) \ You see, when I found the \ body, I heard the time.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] You said "heard"... \ Not "saw"?

[Sahwit] Yes, heard.

[Sahwit] All I saw was the body \ lying there...

[Sahwit] I didn't think to look at \ anything else, least of all \ my watch.

[Phoenix] Hmm... \ Isn't that a little strange?

[Phoenix] So you're saying you \ "heard" something.

[Phoenix] But if you were so shocked by \ the body, you wouldn't hear \ anything at all!

[Payne] *OBJECTION!*

[Payne] The witness did say he \ actually heard the time.

[Payne] It's ludicrous to suggest \ he "wouldn't hear anything"!

[Judge] Hmm... \ I have to agree with \ the prosecution.

[Judge] Witness, continue \ your testimony.

[Sahwit] (2) \ There was a voice saying the \ time... It was probably \ coming from the television.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Are you sure it was a \ television and not... a radio?

[Sahwit] Well, no, I guess it \ might have been a radio.

[Payne] Incidentally, there was \ no radio on the premises.

[Payne] There was only one \ large television.

[Mia] Wright!

[Mia] I can't put my finger on it, \ but something about this seems \ fishy.

[Mia] Something about "hearing" \ the television...

[Payne] The witness has testified. \ He heard the time.

[Sahwit] (3) \ Oh, but it was three hours \ off, wasn't it?

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] How do you explain the gap!

[Judge] Well, witness? \ Can you explain this?

[Sahwit] (4) \ I guess the victim must \ have been watching a video \ of a taped program!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] A.. video?

[Sahwit] Yes, that would explain \ why the time was wrong!

[Phoenix] True, true...

[Mia] Wright!

[Mia] I think the problem lies \ someplace else...

[Judge] We're agreed that you heard \ the time at the scene, then.

[Sahwit] (5) \ That's why I thought \ it was 1:00 PM!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Are you sure the voice you \ heard said it was 1:00 PM?

[Sahwit] Yes, I can practically hear \ it now. It was quite clear.

[Judge] Mr. Payne, has the prosecution \ verified this testimony?

[Payne] My apologies, Your Honor.

[Payne] I, too, have only just learned \ that the witness "heard" \ the time.

[Sahwit] Oh, I'm really sorry. I only \ remembered it just now.

[Sahwit] (6) \ Terribly sorry about \ the misunderstanding...

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Well, you just watch it!

[Phoenix] (Hmm... Not much point \ pressing him on that one, \ was there?)

[Mia] Notice anything suspicious?

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Hold it right there!

[Phoenix] The prosecution has said there \ was a blackout at the time of \ the discovery!

[Phoenix] And this record proves it!

[Sahwit] ...!

[Phoenix] You couldn't have heard \ a television... or a video!

[Sahwit] Gah!!!

[Sahwit] I... well... urk!

[Judge] The defense has a point.

[Judge] Do you have an explanation \ for this, Mr. Sahwit?

[Sahwit] No, I... I find it quite \ puzzling myself! Quite!

[Sahwit] ...

[Sahwit] Aah!

[Sahwit] W-wait! \ I remember now!

[Judge] Mr. Sahwit?

[Judge] The court would prefer to hear \ an accurate testimony from the \ very beginning.

[Judge] These constant corrections \ are harming your credibility.

[Judge] That, and you seem \ rather... distraught.

[Sahwit] ...!

[Sahwit] M-my apologies, Your Honor!

[Sahwit] It... er, it must have \ been the shock of finding \ the body!

[Judge] Very well, Mr. Sahwit.

[Judge] Let's hear your testimony \ once more please.

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Hearing the Time --

[Sahwit] (1) \ Actually, I didn't "hear" \ the time... I "saw" it!

[Sahwit] (2) \ There was a table clock in \ the apartment, wasn't there!

[Sahwit] (3) \ Yeah, the murder weapon! \ The killer used it to \ hit the victim!

[Sahwit] (4) \ That must have \ been what I saw.

[] ...

[Judge] You saw a clock? \ I guess that would explain it.

[Judge] The defense may cross- \ examine the witness.

[Phoenix] Gladly.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Hearing the Time --

[Sahwit] (1) \ Actually, I didn't "hear" \ the time... I "saw" it!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] That strikes me as a very \ suspicious mistake.

[Sahwit] Yes, I can see how you'd \ be a little doubtful...

[Sahwit] I'm really sorry. I only \ just remembered that \ table clock!

[Judge] A "table clock"?

[Sahwit] (2) \ There was a table clock in \ the apartment, wasn't there!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] A "table clock"? \ Was there a clock \ at the scene?

[Judge] This is the first \ I've heard of it!

[Sahwit] (3) \ Yeah, the murder weapon! \ The killer used it to \ hit the victim!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] The... murder weapon?

[Sahwit] Yes, the table clock that \ was used as a weapon!

[Sahwit] That's what I just said. Did \ you doze off in the middle \ of my testimony or something?

[Phoenix] (Something's fishy here...)

[Sahwit] (4) \ That must have \ been what I saw.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Why didn't you tell us \ that in the first place?

[Sahwit] I guess it just \ slipped my mind!

[Sahwit] I'm not really sure how it \ happened myself...

[Payne] The witness says he saw the \ table clock. End of story.

[Mia] Now, find the contradiction!

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Wait just a moment!

[Phoenix] The murder weapon wasn't \ a clock. \ It was this statue!

[Phoenix] Now how is this supposed \ to be a clock?

[Sahwit] Whaa!?

[Sahwit] Y-you with your "objections," \ and your "evidence"... Just \ who do you think you are!?

[Phoenix] Just answer the question, \ Mr. Sahwit.

[Sahwit] Hey, I... I saw it there, okay! \ That's a clock!

[Payne] Your Honor! \ If I may...

[Judge] Yes, Mr. Payne?

[Payne] As the witness stated, this \ statue is indeed a clock.

[Payne] The neck is a switch. You just \ tilt it, and it says the time \ out loud.

[Payne] As it doesn't look like a \ clock, I submitted it as a \ statue. My apologies.

[Judge] I see.

[Judge] So the murder weapon was a \ table clock after all.

[Judge] Well, Mr. Wright?

[Judge] It appears that the witness's \ testimony was correct. \ This is a clock.

[Judge] Do you have any problems \ with his testimony now?

***No***************************************

[Phoenix] I guess not.

[Phoenix] There was a clock on the \ scene, so, no problem.

[Mia] Wright! Are you out \ of your mind!?

[Mia] That clock doesn't look \ like a clock at all!

[Mia] The witness couldn't have \ possibly known it was a clock \ just by seeing it!

[Mia] He said himself, he never \ entered the apartment!

[Mia] It was in his testimony!

[Phoenix] Hey! \ You're right!

[Judge] Is something the matter? \ Does the defense have anything \ to add?

[Phoenix] Yes... \ Yes I do!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Yes**************************************

[Phoenix] Your Honor, there is \ a gaping hole in the \ witness's testimony!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] The only way he could have \ known the weapon was a clock \ is to hold it in his hand.

[Phoenix] Yet the witness testified \ that he never entered the \ apartment!

[Phoenix] Clearly, a contradiction!

[Judge] Hmm... indeed!

[Phoenix] The witness knew it was \ a clock, because he...

***Knew the victim**************************

[Phoenix] Tell me, isn't it true that \ you knew the victim?

[Phoenix] In fact, you were one of her \ "sugar daddies"! Be frank \ with us, Mr. Sahwit!

[Sahwit] Hmph.

[Sahwit] "Frank"? I'm always "Frank"!

[Payne] Your Honor.

[Payne] We have complete records of \ the victim's relationships.

[Payne] Mr. Frank Sahwit does \ not appear anywhere.

[Phoenix] Huh? \ Oh, really?

[Judge] Please, Mr. Wright... \ Is "Huh" the best response \ you can muster up?

[Judge] Try to refrain from making \ off-the-cuff accusations \ in the future.

[Phoenix] Y-yes, Your Honor. \ Let me think this over.

[] RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

***Went into the apartment******************

[Phoenix] You're lying!

[Phoenix] You were inside the apartment \ on the day of the murder!

[Sahwit] Oh yeah? Prove it! \ Prove I went in there!

[Phoenix] I'll do better than that! \ I can prove you were the one \ who killed her!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] You struck her with the clock, \ and the shock of the blow \ triggered the clock's voice!

[Phoenix] That was the sound you heard!

[Judge] Order in the court!

[Judge] Intriguing. \ Please continue, Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] Mr. Sahwit.

[Phoenix] The sound must have left \ quite an impression on you.

[Phoenix] Understandable, since the \ murder weapon spoke just as \ you hit the victim!

[Phoenix] That voice was burned \ into your mind.

[Phoenix] That's why you were so \ certain about the time!

[Payne] *OBJECTION!*

[Payne] W-w-what's the meaning \ of this?

[Payne] This is all baseless \ conjecture!

[Phoenix] Baseless...?

[Phoenix] Just look at the \ witness's face!

[Sahwit] Ngh... grrrah!

[Judge] Would the witness \ care to elaborate?

[Judge] Did you strike the \ victim with the clock?

[Sahwit] I... I...! \ That... that day... \ I... I never!

[Sahwit] Look... I... the clock... \ I heard, no! \ I mean, I saw...Saw... nggg!

[Sahwit] Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

[Sahwit] Shutupshutupshutup! \ I hate you!

[Sahwit] I-it was him, I tell you! \ I saw him!

[Sahwit] H-he killed her and he \ should burn! Burn! \ Give him death!

[Judge] Order! \ Order in the court I say!

[Payne] Your Honor, \ a-a moment please!

[Payne] There isn't a shred of \ evidence supporting the \ defense's claims!

[Judge] Mr. Wright!

[Phoenix] Your Honor?

[Judge] You claim the sound the \ witness heard came from \ the clock...

[Judge] Do you have any evidence?

[Phoenix] (The whole case is riding \ on this! I'd better think \ it through carefully!)

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] The sound Mr. Sahwit heard \ was definitely this clock.

[Phoenix] A fact which is clear \ if you simply...

***Examine the clock's batteries************

[Phoenix] All you have to do \ is examine the batteries!

[Judge] Indeed? The batteries are... \ in the right way. The clock \ seems to be working fine.

[Judge] What exactly did \ you mean, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Yes, the clock was \ working fine!

[Payne] Yes, and...?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Umm, I'm sorry, I think \ I got confused back there \ with all those testimonies.

[Judge] Mr. Wright!

[Judge] I expect more from a lawyer \ in this court. Even if it \ is your first day.

[Judge] I'm afraid I have to \ penalize you! Try to think \ things through more carefully.

[Phoenix] Y-yes, Your Honor. \ As I was saying...

[] BACK TO QUESTION

********************************************

***Ask the neighbors************************

[Phoenix] All you have to do is talk \ to the victim's neighbors!

[Judge] Talk to the neighbors...?

[Phoenix] I'm sure one of them heard \ the clock tell the time when \ the incident occurred!

[Judge] I see...

[Judge] Does the prosecution have \ anything to say, Mr. Payne?

[Payne] We have already made all \ the necessary inquiries.

[Payne] Everyone living near the \ victim's apartment was out \ at the time of the murder.

[Payne] Furthermore, even if a \ neighbor had heard the clock,

[Payne] that would not prove that \ Mr. Sahwit had heard anything.

[Judge] Hmm... \ That is true.

[Judge] I believe you may be wrong, \ Mr. Wright.

[Judge] You'll receive a penalty \ for that, unfortunately.

[Phoenix] I-I'm sorry, Your Honor! \ Let me think about it again!

[] RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

***Try sounding the clock*******************

[Phoenix] Let's sound the clock \ now, here in this court.

[Phoenix] Your Honor, may I \ have the clock?

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] I ask the court to \ listen very carefully...

[Alarm clock] ...*beep*...

[Alarm clock] [I think it's 8:25.]

[Judge] That certainly is a strange \ way to announce the time.

[Phoenix] Well, he is "The Thinker," \ after all.

[Judge] So, we've heard the clock. \ What are your conclusions, \ Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Mr. Payne... can you tell me \ what time it is now?

[Payne] It's 11:25...

[Payne] Ack!

[Phoenix] As you can see, this clock \ is exactly three hours slow!

[Phoenix] Precisely the discrepancy \ between what Mr. Sahwit heard \ and the actual time of death!

[Phoenix] So, Mr. Sahwit...

[Phoenix] Try to talk your \ way out of this one!

[Sahwit] ...

[Sahwit] ...Hah! Hah hah!

[Sahwit] You forgot one thing!

[Phoenix] (Uh oh... what's he \ talking about...?)

[Sahwit] While it may seem like \ that clock IS running three \ hours slow...

[Sahwit] It proves nothing!

[Sahwit] How do you know it was \ running three days slow \ on the day of the murder!?

[Sahwit] If you can't prove that, \ you don't have a case!

[Phoenix] ...!

[Phoenix] (He's right! How am I \ going to prove that!?)

[Phoenix] (Dammit! I was so close!)

[Judge] Mr. Wright?

[Judge] It seems you lack the \ critical evidence to \ support your claim.

[Phoenix] ...!

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[Judge] This means I cannot let \ you indict the witness.

[Judge] Unfortunately...

[Judge] This ends the cross-examination \ of Mr. Frank Sahwit.

[Sahwit] I come all the way down here \ to testify, and look \ what happens!

[Sahwit] They treat me like a \ criminal! A criminal!

[Sahwit] You lawyers are all slime!

[Phoenix] (Grr! I almost had him!)

[Phoenix] (Sorry, Larry... I failed you.)

[Phoenix] (There's nothing I can \ do about it now...)

[] ...

[Mia] Not so fast, Mr. Sahwit!

[Phoenix] Mia! I mean, Chief!

[Mia] Listen up, Wright!

[Mia] Don't throw this one away, \ not like this! Think!

[Phoenix] But, Chief, it's over.

[Phoenix] I can't prove the clock was \ slow the day of the murder!

[Phoenix] Nobody can prove that!

[Mia] Um... well, yes.

[Mia] But that doesn't mean you \ can't still win! Try thinking \ out of the box!

[Mia] Don't waste time doubting the \ facts. Assume the clock was \ three hours slow and...

[Mia] Think through it!

[Mia] Ask yourself, "Why was \ the clock three hours slow"?

[Mia] Figure out the reason, \ and you'll have your proof!

[Mia] Right, Wright?

[Mia] Can you think of a reason as \ to why the clock would be \ three hours slow?

***No***************************************

[Phoenix] H-how am I supposed \ to know that!?

[Mia] I know you can \ figure it out!

[Mia] There must be some evidence \ in the Court Record...

[Mia] Something that can show \ why that clock was three \ hours slow!

[Mia] Find it, and he won't have a \ foot to stand on!

[Judge] Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Y-y-yes, Your Honor!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Yes**************************************

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Wait!

[Phoenix] Maybe I can prove it!

[Mia] You must have evidence \ somewhere that can \ prove it, Wright!

[Mia] Find it and let them have it!

[Judge] Well, Mr. Wright?

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Judge] You say the clock was already \ running slow on the day of \ the murder...

[Judge] Have you found evidence \ to support this claim?

[Phoenix] Of course.

[Phoenix] There is a piece of evidence \ in the Court Record that can \ prove my claim beyond a doubt!

[Sahwit] Hah! Tough words! Let's see \ you pull this one off!

[Judge] Let's see this evidence that \ proves why the clock was \ running slow!

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Judge] Um, excuse me. This proves \ your claim... how?

[Judge] I can't see what that evidence \ has to do with the clock.

[Phoenix] (D'oh! That wasn't it!)

[Phoenix] One more chance... \ Give me just one more chance!

[Judge] Alright, Mr. Wright, but \ time is not on your side.

[Judge] Be quick about it.

[] BACK TO COURT RECORD

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] The victim had just returned \ home from abroad the day \ before the murder.

[Phoenix] As we all know, the time \ difference between here and \ Paris is nine hours!

[Phoenix] When it's 4:00 PM here, \ it's 1:00 AM the next day \ there.

[Phoenix] The clock wasn't three hours \ slow, it was nine hours fast!

[Phoenix] The victim hadn't reset her \ clock since returning home!

[Phoenix] That's why the time you heard \ when you struck her dead in \ her apartment was wrong!

[Phoenix] Proof enough for you, \ Mr. Sahwit? Or should \ I say... Mr. Did It!

[Sahwit] Ngh! ...!

[Judge] O-order! Order, I say!

[] ...

[Judge] Well...

[Judge] This case has certainly \ turned out differently \ than we all expected.

[Judge] Mr. Payne... your client?

[Payne] He... er... he was arrested \ and has been taken away, \ Your Honor.

[Judge] Very well.

[Judge] Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[Judge] I have to say, I'm impressed.

[Judge] I don't think I've ever seen \ someone complete a defense \ so quickly...

[Judge] and find the true culprit \ at the same time!

[Phoenix] Thank you, Your Honor.

[Judge] At this point, this is \ only a formality, but...

[Judge] This court finds the \ defendant, Mr. Larry Butz...

[] N O T   G U I L T Y *

[Judge] And with that... \ The court is adjourned.

[] ...

[Phoenix] It turns out that Frank \ Sahwit was a common burglar!

[Phoenix] He posed as a newspaper sales- \ man to check and see when \ people were out of the house!

[Phoenix] That day...

[Phoenix] When Larry went to her \ apartment, the victim \ wasn't home.

[Phoenix] After he left, Mr. Sahwit \ let himself in to do his \ dirty work!

[Phoenix] While he was searching her \ place, the victim returned!

[Phoenix] Flustered, Mr. Sahwit grabbed \ the nearest blunt object he \ could find...

[Phoenix] (Whew... I still can't \ believe we won!)

[Mia] Wright! \ Good job in there!

[Mia] Congratulations!

[Phoenix] Th-thanks, Chief. \ I owe it all to you.

[Mia] Not at all, not at all! \ You fought your own battles \ in there.

[Mia] It's been a while since I've \ seen a trial end on such a \ satisfying note!

[Phoenix] (I've never seen the chief \ looking this happy...)

[Phoenix] (If she's this glad, imagine \ how Larry must feel!)

[Butz] My life is over...

[Phoenix] Larry! You're supposed to \ be happy! What's wrong now!?

[Butz] Aww, Nick...

[Butz] Don't worry 'bout me! \ I'll be dead and gone soon!

[Phoenix] Good! Wait, no! I mean... \ Bad! Bad bad bad!

[Phoenix] Larry, you're innocent! \ The case is closed.

[Butz] ...

[Butz] But... but my Cindy-windy's \ gone, man! Gone forever!

[Phoenix] (Larry, she was a... \ Nah... Never mind.)

[Mia] Congratulations, Harry!

[Butz] H-Harry...?

[Mia] Yes, you! I can practically \ see the headlines now: \ "Harry Butz, Innocent!"

[Butz] Heh... um... thanks! \ I really owe you one.

[Butz] I won't forget this, ever! \ Let's celebrate! Dinner? \ Movie? My treat!

[Mia] Oh, no, I couldn't.

[Phoenix] (Hey, I was the one who \ got you off the hook!)

[Butz] Oh, hey!

[Butz] H-here, take this! \ It's a present!

[Mia] A present? For me?

[Mia] Wait... \ Wasn't this the evidence \ that...

[Butz] Actually, I made this \ clock for her!

[Butz] I made one for her \ and one for me.

[Mia] R-really? You? You made this?

[Mia] ...

[Mia] Well, thank you. \ I'll keep it as a memento.

[Butz] Yo, Nick...

[Butz] Can you believe it? \ I was so into that chick...

[Butz] And... and she was just \ playing me for a fool!

[Butz] Don't that make you \ wanna just cry? *sob*

[Phoenix] Larry...

[Mia] ...

[Mia] Are you so sure?

[Butz] Ex-squeeze me?

[Mia] I think she thought quite a \ lot of you, in her own way.

[Butz] Nah, you don't gotta \ sympathize with me, 'sokay.

[Mia] Oh, I'm not just \ sympathizing, really.

[Mia] Isn't that right, Wright? \ Don't you have something \ to show your friend?

[Mia] Something that proves how \ she felt about him?

[Phoenix] H-huh? \ Oh, yeah, right!

[Phoenix] (What the heck is \ she talking about?)

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] Here you go, Larry. \ Proof.

[Butz] ...

[Butz] Eh... heh heh? \ It's okay, Nick. \ Don't worry about me.

[Butz] I'll forget about \ her soon enough.

[Butz] Look, I'm gonna head \ home. Thanks a ton, eh?

[Phoenix] (Guess that wasn't the \ right thing to show him...)

[] SKIP TO NEXT SCENE

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] Check this out, Larry. \ Proof Positive you weren't \ just some chump to her.

[Butz] Huh...? \ Where'd you get that clock?

[Phoenix] This is the clock you \ made for her, Larry!

[Phoenix] She took it with her \ when she traveled.

[Butz] Hmm, she probably just \ needed a clock, that's all.

[Phoenix] You think so? It's a pretty \ heavy clock to take traveling.

[Butz] ...

[Phoenix] Well, make of it \ what you will.

[Butz] ...

[Butz] Hey, Nick.

[Butz] I'm glad I asked you \ to be my lawyer.

[Butz] Really, I am. \ Thanks.

[Phoenix] (Hope that made him feel \ a little better...)

[] ...

[Mia] Wright?

[Mia] I hope you see the importance \ of evidence now.

[Mia] Also, hopefully you realize, \ things change depending on \ how you look at them.

[Mia] People, too.

[Mia] We never really know if \ our clients are guilty \ or innocent.

[Mia] All we can do is \ believe in them.

[Mia] And in order to believe in \ them, you have to believe \ in yourself.

[Mia] Wright...

[Mia] Listen. Learn. Grow strong.

[Mia] Never let go of what \ you believe in. Never.

[] ...

[Mia] Well, I think our work here \ is done! Shall we be off?

[Phoenix] Yeah, I guess so!

[Mia] Say, how about dinner. \ On me?

[Mia] We'll drink a toast \ to innocent Butz!

[Phoenix] Yeah!

[Mia] Oh, speaking of Harry...

[Mia] You were saying part of why \ you became a lawyer was \ because of him.

[Phoenix] Er, yeah. Part, at least.

[Mia] You'll have to tell me \ more about it sometime! \ Maybe... over drinks?

[] ...

[Phoenix] And so, my first \ trial came to a close.

[Phoenix] Larry slapped me on the back \ and said, "Gee, Nick, it's good \ to have friends!"

[Phoenix] But I'm pretty sure he's not \ going to pay me. Unless you \ count the clock he gave Mia.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] I didn't know it then...

[Phoenix] but that clock was soon \ going to be at the center \ of another incident.

[Phoenix] And my promise to tell the \ chief about me and Larry...

[Phoenix] would be one promise that \ I wouldn't be able to keep.

[???] That must be "The Thinker" \ that swallowed those papers.

[Mia] How could you know...?

[???] Ho hoh. You are not \ cogniferous of my \ background?

[???] Gathering information is \ my business, you see.

[Mia] I... I should have been more \ careful.

[???] Ho hoh.

[???] My dear Miss Fey... \ I am so very sorry.

[???] But I am afraid I must ask \ you for one more thing.

[???] Your eternal silence... \ Farewell, Miss Fey.

[Phoenix] Uh oh, I'm late.

[Phoenix] Huh, that's strange. \ The chief must have \ gone home already.

[Phoenix] She said her sister was \ coming over so we should \ all go out for dinner...

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] What's that smell...?

[Phoenix] Blood...?

[Phoenix] Mia! \ (Maybe she's in her office!)

[] ...

***Examine Anything*************************

[Phoenix] I smell blood... \ and that can't be good!

[Phoenix] I have to check and see if \ Mia... the Chief's okay!

********************************************

[] MOVE TO: Office

[???] *sob*

[???] Sis...

[Phoenix] (Someone's there!)

[Phoenix] ...!

[Phoenix] Chief? Chief...?

[Phoenix] Chief!!!

[Phoenix] Who are you?

[???] ...

[Phoenix] (The strange girl dropped out \ cold. I left her lying on \ the office sofa.)

[Phoenix] (I went back to the chief \ where she lay under the \ window.)

[Phoenix] (Her body was still warm...)

[Phoenix] (I could feel it when \ held her shoulder.)

[Phoenix] (Then, all too quickly, \ it began to fade...)

[Phoenix] (Until finally she was cold.)

[Phoenix] Chief...

[] ...

***Examine window***************************

[Phoenix] There's a large building \ right across from the office.

[Phoenix] The "Gatewater Hotel." \ A nice, luxurious place.

********************************************

***Examine the thinker**********************

[Phoenix] It's encrusted with \ dried blood.

[Phoenix] How ironic that this became \ the murder weapon... again.

********************************************

***Examine shards of glass******************

[Phoenix] Some shards of glass are \ scattered on the floor.

[Phoenix] They seem to be the remains \ of a glass light stand.

********************************************

***Examine office chair*********************

[Phoenix] The chief's chair.

[Phoenix] A simple, functional design. \ Feels pretty good to sit in, \ too.

********************************************

***Examine Mia******************************

[Phoenix] Chief...

[Phoenix] It's hard seeing her like \ this, but if there are any \ clues here...

[Phoenix] She was struck on the head \ with a blunt object.

[Phoenix] She probably died instantly.

[Phoenix] "The Thinker" lying next \ to her must have been \ the murder weapon.

[] The Thinker added \ to the Court Record.

[Phoenix] Hmm... there are some glass \ shards near the chief's body.

[Phoenix] Must be pieces of the glass \ light stand lying broken in \ the back of the room.

[] Glass Shards added \ to the Court Record.

[Phoenix] Nothing else that seems \ like a clue here...

[Phoenix] Hmm...?

[Phoenix] A piece of paper! It must \ have fallen from Mia's hand!

[Phoenix] What could it be?

********************************************

***Examine Mia again************************

[Phoenix] It's painful to look... but \ I have to, for Mia's sake.

[Phoenix] Looks like she was hit \ in the head with a blunt \ weapon.

[Phoenix] She probably died \ instantly.

********************************************

***Examine paper before meeting Maya********

[Phoenix] !

[Phoenix] A word is written in blood \ on this scrap of paper!

[Phoenix] "Maya"...? \ Did Mia write this?

[Phoenix] This piece of paper is a \ receipt from a department \ store, dated yesterday.

[] Receipt added to \ the Court Record.

[Phoenix] (I think that's enough \ snooping around for now.)

[Phoenix] (I'd better call the police...)

[Phoenix] "Spend big on stuff the \ clients use, but keep your \ own stuff simple."

********************************************

***Examine computer*************************

[Phoenix] Surprisingly, the chief \ was never good with machines.

[Phoenix] About all she used this \ PC for was e-mail.

[Phoenix] She picked up this ancient \ model at some garage sale \ for practically nothing.

********************************************

***Examine right bookcase*******************

[Phoenix] All the chief's important \ documents are packed in here.

[Phoenix] This is where she filed \ her case records and \ recent rulings.

********************************************

[Phoenix] Right! \ I'd better call the police!

[Phoenix] ...?

[Phoenix] That's funny...

[Phoenix] A few of the screws on the \ receiver are missing...

[Phoenix] It looks like someone was \ halfway through taking \ it apart.

[???] Police!?

[???] Please, come quick!

[Phoenix] (Wh-what was that!?)

[Phoenix] (Someone screaming from \ outside the window!?)

[Phoenix] ...!

[Phoenix] She's staring right at me!

[Phoenix] She's holding a phone \ in her hand...

[Phoenix] (I put her right there \ on that sofa...!)

[Phoenix] Yipes!

[Phoenix] (Don't scare me like that...)

[Phoenix] Umm...

[Phoenix] Excuse me but, who are you?

[???] ...

[Phoenix] It's okay. I work here.

[Maya] Maya...

***Talk about "What happened"***************

[Phoenix] (She seems to be in shock. \ I don't want to disturb her, \ but I have to know...)

[Phoenix] Um... excuse me?

[Phoenix] Can you tell me \ what happened?

[Maya] ...

[Maya] I came in... \ The room was dark.

[Maya] And Sis... Sis...!

[Phoenix] (So she was already dead.)

********************************************

***Talk about "You and the Chief"***********

[Phoenix] So, you're the chief's...?

[Maya] Sister. I'm her \ younger sister.

[Phoenix] Evidence...?

[Maya] Yes... \ I-it was that clock...

[Maya] It was "The Thinker."

[Maya] The Th-Thinker...

[Maya] That was... \ Oh, Sis! *sob*

[Phoenix] (Hmm, probably shouldn't have \ asked her about the murder \ weapon...)

********************************************

***Present Glass Shards*********************

[Phoenix] This was lying next \ to the chief.

[Maya] I know. I saw it there too.

[Maya] I thought they might be \ pieces of the light stand.

[Phoenix] Hmm. Maybe.

[Phoenix] (Never heard of a glass \ light stand before...)

********************************************

***Present Receipt**************************

[Phoenix] Before Mia died, she wrote \ a message with her own blood.

[Phoenix] She wrote it on the \ back of this receipt.

[Maya] !

[Maya] Th-th-that's MY name!

[Maya] W-why!? \ Why would she write my name?

[Phoenix] Please, just calm down.

[Maya] W-why would \ Sis write my name?

[Phoenix] (Uh-oh. Now I've done it...)

[] CONTINUE IF TELEPHONE NOT EXAMINED

[Phoenix] (I'd better hurry up \ and call the police!)

********************************************

***Examine door*****************************

[Phoenix] The door to the chief's \ office. It's slightly open.

[Phoenix] I'd better not touch \ the door knob.

[Phoenix] The reception desk. \ I usually sit here.

[Gumshoe] Anyway, I don't want either \ of you moving one inch, 'kay?

[Maya] K-killer...? I'm not--

[Gumshoe] Case closed! You're coming \ down to the precinct, ma'am.

[Maya] W-what?

[] ...

[Phoenix] Mia's younger sister, Maya, \ was arrested on the spot.

[Phoenix] I was taken in for questioning \ and didn't get out until the \ next morning.

[Phoenix] My eyes were heavy... \ but I couldn't sleep.

[Phoenix] I sat around, waiting for \ visiting hours to begin at \ the detention center.

[Phoenix] I had to talk to Maya \ as soon as possible.

[Maya] Yes?

[Phoenix] What's with that outfit?

[Maya] Oh, this?

[Maya] This is what all acolytes \ wear. It's my uniform, you \ could say.

[Phoenix] A-acolytes? Like people in \ religious training? What is \ it you do?

[Maya] Oh! It's nothing \ strange, really!

[Maya] I'm a spirit medium. \ ...In training.

[Phoenix] Could you tell me about \ the day of the murder?

[Maya] Yes!

[Maya] Let's see... that morning, \ I got a call from my sister.

[Phoenix] Evidence?

[Maya] Yes. That clock shaped like \ "The Thinker."

[Phoenix] How could that have been \ evidence in a case?

[Maya] Um, right, she said \ something about that...

[Maya] ...

[Maya] I remember!

[Phoenix] H-her own voice!?

[Maya] No, it's okay.

[Maya] All I've been doing the \ last few hours is talking \ about it.

[Maya] I've kind of gotten \ used to it...

[Maya] Let's see... that morning, \ I got a call from my sister.

[Maya] She wanted me to hold onto \ a piece of evidence for an \ upcoming trial.

[Phoenix] (That's "The Thinker" clock \ that Larry made.)

[Phoenix] So then, when did you \ arrive at the office?

[Maya] It was right around 9:00.

[Maya] The lights were off and... \ I could smell blood.

[Maya] Th-then I found her. \ My sister...

********************************************

***Talk about "Spirit mediums"**************

[Phoenix] So you're an acolyte. \ A, er, medium-in-training.

[Maya] That's right.

[Maya] The Fey family, especially the \ women, have always been very \ sensitive to the spirit world.

[Phoenix] Wait a second, you said \ the "Fey Family"?

[Phoenix] So, Mia was into \ this stuff too?

[Maya] Of course!

[Maya] She left the mountain to \ "follow her career," she said.

[Maya] Her powers were first- \ class, too!

[Phoenix] (I... I had no idea.)

[Phoenix] Hmm...

[Phoenix] Wait...!

[Maya] What?

[Phoenix] So, you're a real, honest- \ to-goodness spirit medium? \ With E.S.P. and all that?

[Maya] Yes. \ ...In training.

[Phoenix] Well, can't you contact \ Mia's spirit, then?

[Phoenix] We can just ask \ her who killed her!

[Maya] ...!

[Maya] I-I'm sorry...

[Maya] I'm still in training.

[Maya] I couldn't do something \ on that level...

[Phoenix] (Hmm... I thought that \ would be too easy.)

[Phoenix] Something wrong?

[Maya] Actually, I asked the police \ to contact him, and they \ tried calling a few times.

[Maya] Nobody could get \ a hold of him!

[Phoenix] They couldn't find him?

[Maya] I have no one left to ask!

[Phoenix] ...?

[Phoenix] Say, what about \ your parents...?

[Maya] ...

[Maya] ...

[Maya] ...

[Phoenix] O-okay! Don't worry, \ I'll go ask him for you.

[Gumshoe] Hmm? \ You want to know \ the results, eh?

[Phoenix] ...

[Gumshoe] Now don't you look \ at me like that, pal!

[Gumshoe] It's no use!

[Gumshoe] She might have been your \ boss, but that doesn't mean \ you get any special treatment.

[Gumshoe] Alright, alright. \ You can see the report, \ but that's all!

[] Autopsy Report added \ to the Court Record.

********************************************

***Talk about "Mia" again*******************

[Phoenix] So, Mia's death was \ instantaneous.

[Gumshoe] That's right, pal.

[Gumshoe] She was... a beautiful person.

[Phoenix] You knew her, Detective?

[Gumshoe] Sure. All of us down at \ the precinct knew Ms. Fey.

[Gumshoe] Much as it pains me to say \ this, she was a darn good \ lawyer.

[Gumshoe] Hey, what are you looking at? \ I just got a little dust \ in my eye, that's all.

********************************************

***Talk about "Maya"************************

[Phoenix] Um, about Maya...

[Gumshoe] Yeah! \ I'm looking forward \ to the trial!

[Gumshoe] Sorry, pal, but this is \ one trial you aren't \ going to win!

[Phoenix] W-why do you say that?

[Gumshoe] The city's put Prosecutor \ Edgeworth on the prosecution!

[Phoenix] (Edgeworth...)

[Gumshoe] I'm sure you know what \ that means, you being a \ lawyer and all.

********************************************

***Talk about "Edgeworth"*******************

[Phoenix] Prosecutor Edgeworth...

[Gumshoe] That's right, pal! \ Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself!

[Gumshoe] Wait... you do know him, \ don't you!?

***Of course I do!**************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * I know him. He's a feared \ * prosecutor. He doesn't feel \ * pain, he doesn't feel remorse.

[] * -Phoenix \ * He won't stop until he gets \ * his "guilty" verdict.

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Aww, don't talk about him \ * that way. You make him \ * barely sound human!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Still, I'm afraid this pretty \ * much decides the case.

[] * -Phoenix \ * (So, Edgeworth is on this \ * one...)

[] * -Phoenix \ * (He hasn't lost a case since \ * he became prosecutor at the \ * incredibly young age of 20.)

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Of course, there are rumors \ * of back-alley deals and \ * forged evidence...)

[] * -Phoenix \ * (All I know for sure is that \ * Edgeworth hates crime with \ * an almost abnormal passion.)

[] * -Phoenix \ * (I never imagined I'd be \ * facing him so soon...)

[] * CONTINUE

********************************************

***Of course not!***************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * Never heard of him.

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Whoa! \ * And you call yourself \ * a lawyer, pal!?

[] * -Gumshoe \ * About four years ago, this \ * Edgeworth guy became a \ * prosecutor at the age of 20!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Everyone says he's a genius. \ * Surprised you don't know him!

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Of course I know him... \ * I was just playing dumb.)

[] * -Phoenix \ * (He's a cold, heartless \ * machine who'll do anything \ * to get a "guilty" verdict!)

[] * -Phoenix \ * (There are rumors of \ * back-alley deals and forged \ * evidence...)

[] * CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] (All I know for sure is that \ Edgeworth hates crime with \ an almost abnormal passion.)

********************************************

***Present The Thinker**********************

[Phoenix] I was wondering, do you \ know anything about this?

[Gumshoe] That statue? \ That's the murder weapon.

[Phoenix] (Huh? He thinks the clock \ is just a statue, too...)

[Phoenix] (I'm starting to wish I'd \ never seen this thing.)

********************************************

***Present Glass Shards*********************

[Phoenix] There was broken glass \ at the crime scene, right?

[Gumshoe] Hmm? Oh, that?

[Gumshoe] Seems like a glass stand \ next to the victim fell over.

[Gumshoe] The glass shards were pieces \ of the broken stand.

********************************************

***Present Receipt**************************

[Phoenix] There was a piece of \ paper next to the victim, \ wasn't there?

[Gumshoe] Yeah. The one with the \ killer's name written on it!

[Phoenix] Are you sure that Mia \ wrote it herself?

[Gumshoe] Given the condition of the \ writing, it's hard to say if \ it's her handwriting or not.

[Phoenix] (So there's no proof \ that Mia wrote it.)

********************************************

***Present Maya's Memo**********************

[Phoenix] I was wondering... did you \ see Maya Fey's cell phone?

[Gumshoe] Oh that? \ I have that.

[Phoenix] Do you think you \ could give it back?

[Gumshoe] Sure! \ I mean, wait a second, pal!

[Gumshoe] Tricky lawyer!

[Phoenix] (Uh-oh, he's on to me!)

***Tell him straight************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Hmm... if I tell him why \ * I want it there's no way \ * he'll give it to me!)

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Something the matter?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Oh, no, it's just... \ * You know, Detective!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Nope. \ * I know nothing, pal!

[] * -Phoenix \ * That cell phone has a lot of \ * numbers on it... like her \ * boyfriend's...

[] * -Phoenix \ * A cell phone holds all a \ * little girl's sweetest \ * and spiciest secrets!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Urk? Y-you're trying \ * to confuse me!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Sorry, pal. I already checked \ * all the numbers in memory!

[] * -Phoenix \ * Impressive! You're \ * quite the detective.

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Uh huh. Oh, here, you \ * can have the phone back.

[] * -Gumshoe \ * There weren't any suspicious \ * call records in there, \ * after all.

[] * CONTINUE

********************************************

***Tell him not-so-straight*****************

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Okay, I can't be straight \ * with this guy... but what \ * should I tell him?)

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Something the matter?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Oh, no, um...

[] * -Phoenix \ * T-that carrying strap \ * on the cell phone...

[] * -Gumshoe \ * This? Hmm... it says "The \ * Steel Samurai: Warrior of \ * Neo Olde Tokyo"...

[] * -Gumshoe \ * "The Steel Samurai"... that \ * action hero on TV?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Yeah, you see that strap is \ * a collector's item...

[] * -Phoenix \ * She... was worried it might \ * get lost if it went down \ * to the precinct.

[] * -Gumshoe \ * That what she said?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Um. Yes.

[] * -Gumshoe \ * ...

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Okay, pal.

[] * -Gumshoe \ * I wrote down all the numbers \ * she called anyway.

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Here you go.

[Phoenix] Thanks for this!

[Gumshoe] Don't mention it, pal.

[Gumshoe] When it comes to dealing \ with lawyers, "fight fair \ and square," is our motto!

[Phoenix] (I don't know how I feel, \ seeing everything written \ up like this...)

[Phoenix] (It makes Mia's death \ seem so... routine.)

[Gumshoe] Hmm? What's that?

[Phoenix] Um, yes, thank you. \ I'll be heading out now.

[Gumshoe] Oh, wait.

[Gumshoe] One more thing I wanted \ to mention to you.

[Gumshoe] I don't suppose you're \ planning on talking to \ that witness.

[Gumshoe] Anyway, you'd better not!

[Gumshoe] No influencing the witness \ with your lawyerly ways, pal!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] (Come to think of it, I had \ completely forgotten about \ her...)

[Phoenix] The... witness?

[Gumshoe] Yeah, Miss April May.

[Gumshoe] I'm sorry 'bout this...

[Gumshoe] But I can't tell you \ anything about her!

[Phoenix] (Well, you just told me \ her name, Miss May, huh?)

[Phoenix] So you've sent her \ home already, then?

[Gumshoe] Ahah! You're trying your \ lawyerly tricks on me now!

[Gumshoe] She's not to go outside her \ room until the trial!

[Phoenix] (So... she's still in the \ hotel across the way.)

[Phoenix] I guess I should no better \ than to try to get a \ detective to leak information.

[Gumshoe] You got that right, pal!

[Phoenix] (Time to pay a visit \ to Miss May!)

[Phoenix] (Not to mention run an \ office like this.)

[Phoenix] (I guess I'll just have \ to come back later.)

***Examine painting*************************

[Phoenix] That painting has been \ bugging me ever since \ I stepped in here.

[Phoenix] The oil paint is so \ thick it's practically \ giving me a stuffed nose.

[Phoenix] I'm sure the price is \ nothing to sneeze at \ either, for that matter.

********************************************

***Examine table****************************

[Phoenix] A table for clients.

[Phoenix] Hmm... an elegant ebony case, \ and if I'm not mistaken, that \ lighter's made of solid gold.

[Phoenix] Even I can tell someone \ here's got money to burn.

********************************************

***Examine plant****************************

[Phoenix] An expensive potted plant.

[Phoenix] No idea what kind of plant it \ is, but it's probably the \ most expensive one available.

********************************************

***Examine desk*****************************

[Phoenix] A solid mahogany desk.

[Phoenix] The wood's been polished \ to a deep luster.

[Maya] Hey!

[Phoenix] Sorry.

[Phoenix] I haven't seen him yet.

[Maya] I see...

***Present Maya's Cell Phone****************

[Phoenix] Hey, I got your \ cell phone back.

[Maya] Oh! Say...

[Maya] Can I listen \ to my sister's voice?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] (Maya's eyes closed... \ She listened to every word \ with such intensity...)

[Phoenix] (Before long, tears began \ to roll down her cheeks.)

[Phoenix] ...

[Maya] Thank you.

********************************************

***Talk about "Your family"*****************

[Phoenix] What about your family?

[Maya] I only had my sister.

[Maya] My father died when \ I was very young.

[Maya] And I don't know \ where my mother is.

[Phoenix] (Don't know...? \ So she could still be alive?)

********************************************

***Talk about "Your mother"*****************

[Maya] The women in my family have \ been mediums for generations.

[Maya] They say that E.S.P. \ runs in our blood.

[Maya] About fifteen years ago,

[Maya] our family was involved \ in an... incident.

[Maya] There was a man, \ and he... he...

[Maya] He ruined our mother's life.

[Phoenix] ("Ruined"...?)

[Maya] After that, she disappeared.

[Maya] Several years after that,

[Maya] my sister announced she would \ "become a lawyer" and she \ left the mountain.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] So, you live by yourself?

[Maya] Yes. \ I've gotten used to it.

[Maya] Oh, also...

[Maya] I had to become independent, \ or I would lose my E.S.P.!

[Phoenix] (I feel bad for her, \ all by herself up \ on that mountain...)

********************************************

***Talk about "Your mother's enemy"*********

[Phoenix] So, who was this man \ who, um, "ruined" your mother?

[Maya] About 15 years ago... \ there was an unusual \ murder case.

[Maya] It made quite a stir, \ everyone was talking \ about it, apparently.

[Maya] The police were running out \ of leads, and they were \ getting desperate...

[Phoenix] Wait... they didn't use \ a spirit medium, did they?

[Maya] The police convinced my mother \ to try to contact the victim.

[Phoenix] Wow... \ So, what happened?

[Maya] The case was solved... \ we thought.

[Phoenix] You "thought"...?

[Maya] The man my mother helped \ the police capture was \ innocent.

[Phoenix] ...!

[Maya] The police's consultation with \ a medium had all been carried \ out in secret, of course.

[Maya] But...

[Maya] A man found out about it \ and leaked it to the press.

[Maya] He told all the papers that \ my mother was a fraud, and the \ media jumped on it big time.

[Maya] She... my mother... became \ the laughing stock of the \ nation.

[Phoenix] I see.

[Maya] ...

[Maya] White...

[Phoenix] Excuse me? White?

[Maya] That was his name. \ My sister told me.

[Phoenix] White? Hmm...

[April] He said, "Don't say nothing \ to that lawyer, pal!" Tee hee!

[Phoenix] (Memo to self: thank \ Detective Gumshoe for \ making my job harder.)

[April] Gee! This is all like \ something out of a movie!

[April] It's all so exciting \ I can hardly contain \ myself!

[April] Ooh! Let me go freshen up \ so I can look the part of \ the beautiful eyewitness!

[Phoenix] A bottle and two glasses \ are on the table.

[Phoenix] Somebody must be \ staying with her.

***Examine window***************************

[Phoenix] The late summer sunlight \ streams through the window.

[Phoenix] There's the Fey & Co. \ Law Offices building, \ of course.

[Phoenix] You can see the inside of \ the room pretty clearly \ from here.

[Phoenix] I think it would be a little \ difficult to recognize a face \ from this distance, though.

********************************************

[Phoenix] A simple bed.

[Phoenix] It's been recently made. \ Nothing eye-catching here.

[Phoenix] I need you to describe what \ you observed at the time of \ the incident.

[April] Ooh. "Observe," "incident"! \ You sound just like a lawyer \ in the movies!

[April] I like a man with \ a big... vocabulary.

[Phoenix] (Umm... *gulp* \ Better not encourage her.)

[Phoenix] Er... you know that thing \ that occur... um... happened \ the other day? The bad thing?

[Phoenix] What did you see \ when it happened?

[Phoenix] Oh, no, not me, \ I'm, er, just a lawyer!

[Phoenix] (It was when I tried to \ look into the drawer that \ she got all defensive.)

[Phoenix] (There has to be \ something in there!)

[] MOVE TO: Gatewater Hotel

[] ...

[Bellboy] Good afternoon, sir!

[Phoenix] Excuse me, you are...?

[Bellboy] Ah, I beg your pardon, sir!

[Bellboy] I am the bellboy of \ this establishment, \ at your service, sir.

[Phoenix] Oh, right.

[Bellboy] I've just come up to \ deliver room service, sir.

[Phoenix] Um... do you know where \ Miss May might be?

[Bellboy] Ah. I believe our guest \ Miss May is currently using \ the, er, facilities...?

[Bellboy] If you've no need of \ anything, I'll be \ taking my leave.

[Bellboy] Please, stay as long as you \ like. Enjoy...

[Phoenix] Yeah...

[Phoenix] Wait... no! Hey!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] (Why does it seem like every \ time I come here, I end up \ embarrassing myself?)

[Phoenix] (Wait... now's my chance \ to snoop around a bit!)

[Bellboy] Ah, I almost forgot!

[Phoenix] Gah! \ Y-you came back quick!

[Bellboy] Might I ask you to inform \ Miss May that there is a \ message for her?

[Bellboy] Please tell her that \ Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned.

[Phoenix] Oh, right. Sure.

[Phoenix] (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? \ Where have I heard that name?)

[Maya] White...

[Maya] That was his name. \ My sister told me.

[Phoenix] ("White" was the name of the \ guy who ruined Mia and \ Maya's mother!)

[Phoenix] (Could it be a coincidence?)

***Examine open drawer**********************

[Phoenix] There's a screwdriver sticking \ out of that half-open drawer.

[Phoenix] Now's my chance to \ see what's inside!

[Phoenix] ...!

[Phoenix] What do we have here!

[Phoenix] A... wiretap? \ Hmm!

[Phoenix] What would a woman like her \ be doing with a thing like this?

[] Wiretap added to \ the Court Record.

********************************************

[Phoenix] There is definitely \ something suspicious \ about this "Miss May"!

[Phoenix] Why would she have something \ like this in her hotel room?

[Phoenix] There's a story behind all \ this, I know it!

[Phoenix] Alright...

[Phoenix] I'll be using this bit of \ evidence in tomorrow's \ trial, that's for sure.

[Phoenix] For Maya's sake...

[Phoenix] I'll get to this woman's \ bottom! Wait... I mean \ ... you know what I mean.

[April] Oh, bellboy...? \ Still there?

[Phoenix] (Uh oh, time to scram!)

[Phoenix] (I look forward to tangoing \ with you tomorrow, Miss May!)

[Phoenix] (In court!)

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green September 7, 10:00 AM \ District Court \ Courtroom No. 1

[Judge] The court is now in session \ for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution is \ ready, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] The defense \ is ready, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] (Miles Edgeworth...)

[Phoenix] (I'd better not show any signs \ of weakness today, or he'll \ be on me in an instant.)

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth. \ Please give the court \ your opening statement.

[Edgeworth] Thank you, Your Honor. \ The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, \ was at the scene of the crime.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution has evidence \ she committed this murder...

[Edgeworth] and we have a witness \ who saw her do it.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution sees no \ reason to doubt the facts \ of this case, Your Honor.

[Judge] I see.

[Judge] Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. \ Let's begin then.

[Edgeworth] You may call your \ first witness.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution calls the \ chief officer at the scene, \ Detective Gumshoe!

[] ...

[Edgeworth] Witness, please state your \ name and profession to \ the court.

[Gumshoe] Sir!

[Gumshoe] My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir!

[Gumshoe] I'm the detective in \ charge of homicides \ down at the precinct, sir!

[Edgeworth] Detective Gumshoe.

[Edgeworth] Please, describe for us \ the details of this murder.

[Gumshoe] Very well, sir! \ Let me use this floor map \ of the office to explain.

[Gumshoe] The body was found by \ this window, here.

[Edgeworth] And the cause of death?

[Gumshoe] Loss of blood due to being \ struck by a blunt object, sir!

[Gumshoe] The murder weapon was a statue \ of "The Thinker" found next \ to the body, sir!

[Gumshoe] It was heavy enough to \ be a deadly weapon, even \ in a girl's hands, sir!

[Judge] The court accepts the \ statue as evidence.

[Phoenix] (They're still calling \ it a "statue"...)

[] Floor plans added to \ the Court Record.

[Edgeworth] Now, Detective...

[Gumshoe] Y-yes sir!

[Edgeworth] You immediately arrested \ Ms. Maya Fey, who was found \ at the scene, correct?

[Edgeworth] Can you tell me why?

[Gumshoe] Yes sir! \ I had hard evidence \ she did it, sir!

[Judge] Hmm. \ Detective Gumshoe,

[Judge] Please testify to the court \ about this "hard evidence."

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Maya Fey's Arrest --

[Gumshoe] (1) \ As soon as the phone call came \ in, I rushed to the scene!

[Gumshoe] (2) \ There were two people \ there already:

[Gumshoe] (3) \ The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, \ and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix \ Wright.

[Gumshoe] (4) \ I immediately arrested \ Ms. Maya Fey!

[Gumshoe] (5) \ Why? We had a witness \ account describing her!

[Gumshoe] (6) \ The witness saw Ms. Maya \ Fey at the very moment of \ the murder!

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm... \ The very moment, you say.

[Judge] Very well. Mr. Wright, \ you may begin your \ cross-examination.

[Phoenix] Y-yes, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] (Cross-examine what...?)

[Phoenix] (I couldn't see a single \ contradiction in that \ testimony...)

[] ...whoosh...

[] SMACK!

[Phoenix] (Hey! Maya just threw \ something at me...)

[Phoenix] (What's this?)

[Phoenix] ("When my sister couldn't \ find any contradictions \ in a witness's testimony")

[Phoenix] ("she would bluff it and \ press the witness on \ every detail!")

[Phoenix] ("The witness always slips \ up and says something \ wrong...")

[Phoenix] ("It worked lots of times!")

[Phoenix] (Heh... I should have expected \ Maya would know some of \ her sister's tricks!)

[Phoenix] (Alright. \ Let's give this a try!)

[Judge] Something the matter?

[Phoenix] No, Your Honor. \ I'd like to begin my \ cross-examination.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Maya Fey's Arrest --

[Gumshoe] (1) \ As soon as the phone call came \ in, I rushed to the scene!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Who did you say you \ got a call from?

[Gumshoe] Hey pal, don't play \ dumb! You know who!

[Gumshoe] The call was from a customer \ at the Gatewater Hotel, right \ across from the crime scene!

[Phoenix] (Hmm... okay, I pressed. \ Not sure it did much, though.)

[Phoenix] Right. \ Please continue.

[Gumshoe] (2) \ There were two people \ there already:

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe, how \ long would you say it took,

[Phoenix] between you receiving \ the call, and your arrival \ at the scene of the crime?

[Gumshoe] Hmm, right... I'd say \ it was about 3 minutes!

[Phoenix] Th-that's pretty fast!

[Gumshoe] Our motto this month \ is "quick response"!

[Gumshoe] That's how I got there \ before the killer got away!

[Edgeworth] Indeed!

[Edgeworth] So, tell us who the two \ people you found on the \ scene were.

[Gumshoe] Yes sir!

[Gumshoe] (3) \ The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, \ and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix \ Wright.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Are you absolutely \ sure it was us?

[Gumshoe] Listen pal, your dumb act \ will only get you so far!

[Gumshoe] With her funky hippie clothes \ and your spiky hair?

[Gumshoe] You two stand out like... \ like suspicious people \ at a crime scene!

[Phoenix] (Well... he does have \ a point about her.)

[Phoenix] (She is pretty unmistakable.)

[Phoenix] (I should pick my points \ to press with a little \ more care...)

[Gumshoe] (4) \ I immediately arrested \ Ms. Maya Fey!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Why's that? \ What's your reason?

[Gumshoe] (5) \ Why? We had a witness \ account describing her!

[] END CROSS-EXAMINATION

[Gumshoe] (6) \ The witness saw Ms. Maya \ Fey at the very moment of \ the murder!

[] END CROSS-EXAMINATION

[Phoenix] (I can't see a single \ contradiction in there!)

[Phoenix] (I'll just have to take \ Maya's advice and press \ him on anything suspicious!)

[] ...

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Hold on just one second!

[Gumshoe] Y-yeah?

[Phoenix] If I heard correctly...

[Phoenix] You said you arrested her \ because you had "hard \ evidence" she did it, correct?

[Gumshoe] Huh?

[Gumshoe] Did... did I say that? Me?

[Phoenix] I heard you say it!

[Judge] You did say it.

[Edgeworth] You said it.

[Phoenix] Exactly what about this \ suspicious woman in pink's \ claim was "hard evidence"!?

[Gumshoe] Wh-what!?

[Gumshoe] Miss May isn't suspicious, \ and she sure isn't pink, pal!

[Gumshoe] W-well, I guess she \ is pink...

[Judge] That's enough, \ Detective Gumshoe.

[Judge] Do you have any more \ solid proof other than \ her claims, Detective?

[Gumshoe] Umm...

[Phoenix] (Hmm! I guess pressing \ can have its advantages!)

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] Yes.

[Phoenix] (Gah!)

[Gumshoe] Sorry, I got the order \ of things mixed up in my \ testimony, Your Honor Sir!

[Gumshoe] There was something I \ should have told you \ about first, Your Honor!

[Judge] Very well, Detective. Let's \ hear your testimony again.

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Hard Evidence --

[Gumshoe] (1) \ After securing the suspect, \ I examined the scene of \ the crime with my own eyes.

[Gumshoe] (2) \ I found a memo written on \ a piece of paper next to \ the victim's body!

[Gumshoe] (3) \ On it, the word "Maya" \ was written clearly in blood!

[Gumshoe] (4) \ Lab test results showed that \ the blood was the victim's!

[Gumshoe] (5) \ Also, there was blood found \ on the victim's finger!

[Gumshoe] (6) \ Before she died, the victim \ wrote the killer's name!

[Gumshoe] How you like that? \ That's my "hard evidence"!

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Before we begin cross- \ examination, I have a \ question for you, Detective.

[Gumshoe] Y-Your Honor?

[Judge] Why didn't you testify about \ this vital piece of evidence \ the first time!?

[Gumshoe] Ah... eh... I know. I'm real \ embarrassed I forgot about \ it, Your Honor Sir.

[Judge] Try to be more careful!

[Judge] Very well, the defense may \ begin its cross-examination.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Hard Evidence --

[Gumshoe] (1) \ After securing the suspect, \ I examined the scene of \ the crime with my own eyes.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] And did you find \ any evidence?

[Gumshoe] Now, now, don't jump \ the gun on me, pal.

[Gumshoe] Just listen. I'm getting \ to the good part!

[Phoenix] (I got a bad feeling \ about this...)

[Gumshoe] (2) \ I found a memo written on \ a piece of paper next to \ the victim's body!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Just because you found it \ next to the body doesn't \ mean the victim wrote it!

[Gumshoe] Ho hoh! \ Then who did write \ it, smarty-pants?

[Phoenix] Wh-who? Um...

***The killer*******************************

[Phoenix] Th-the killer! \ Anyone can see that!

[Gumshoe] Hoh.

[Gumshoe] You're saying the killer \ wrote her OWN name!? \ Buddy, please!

[Phoenix] She was framed!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Hold on.

[Edgeworth] If that's the case, \ where's your evidence?

[Phoenix] Ah... \ (Urk!)

[Edgeworth] Hah! I guess that was \ a bit of a tall order \ for you.

[Edgeworth] Those without evidence \ shouldn't open their \ mouths, Mr. Wright.

[Gumshoe] Yeah, pal!

[Phoenix] (Argh...!)

********************************************

***Miss May*********************************

[Phoenix] Well... it could have been \ the witness, Miss May!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Hold on.

[Edgeworth] The witness was in her \ hotel room, not the office.

[Edgeworth] Try pulling the other leg, \ Mr. Wright!

[Gumshoe] Yeah, and while you're at \ it, pull mine too, pal!

[Phoenix] (Argh...!)

********************************************

***I did************************************

[Phoenix] It... it could have been me!

[Gumshoe] What! S-so it was you!

[Phoenix] No, no, no, I'm just saying \ it COULD have been me!

[Phoenix] Can you prove it wasn't?

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Hold on.

[Edgeworth] So, you admit to this?

[Edgeworth] You admit that you \ wrote the note?

[Phoenix] Uh...

[Edgeworth] Listen to me, Mr. Wright.

[Edgeworth] This is a court of law, and \ I expect you to refrain from \ making thoughtless statements!

[Edgeworth] Amateur!

[Phoenix] (...!)

********************************************

[Edgeworth] Well, Detective? \ Tell us what was written \ on that memo you found.

[Gumshoe] (3) \ On it, the word "Maya" \ was written clearly in blood!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Do you have proof it \ was Mia who wrote that!?

[Gumshoe] Of course I do, pal!

[Phoenix] (Uh oh... he sounded pretty \ confident. This might \ not be good...)

[Gumshoe] (4) \ Lab test results showed that \ the blood was the victim's!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What kind of "tests" \ were these again?

[Gumshoe] Huh? What kind? \ Umm... well...

[Gumshoe] I hear they take the, um, \ little bits in the blood, \ the... er... hemo... hemogl...

[Gumshoe] Hermo... goblins... hobgob... \ Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin...

[Gumshoe] I-I refuse to testify \ on this matter, sir!

[Gumshoe] I'm no expert on blood tests!

[Judge] Yes, that was quite clear. \ You may continue with \ your testimony.

[Gumshoe] Th-thanks, pal. \ I mean Your Honor Sir.

[Edgeworth] Detective Gumshoe.

[Gumshoe] Y-yeah?

[Edgeworth] I think you can expect \ a pleasant bonus in your \ next pay check.

[Gumshoe] Oh? Oh hoh hoh.

[Phoenix] (That was a mess...)

[Gumshoe] Right! Where was I?

[Gumshoe] (5) \ Also, there was blood found \ on the victim's finger!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] On which hand was the \ bloody finger, Detective?

[Gumshoe] The right hand!

[Phoenix] (Hmm... she WAS right \ handed...)

[Gumshoe] Hah hah hah! \ Nice try!

[Phoenix] (Uh oh... I guess it wasn't \ too hard to see what I \ was getting at there.)

[Gumshoe] (6) \ Before she died, the victim \ wrote the killer's name!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe!

[Phoenix] Do you get a lot of cases \ where the victim actually \ writes the killer's name?

[Gumshoe] Sure! It happens all the \ time in books and the movies!

[Phoenix] This isn't a movie, Detective.

[Gumshoe] Oof!

[Phoenix] Let's talk about \ reality, shall we?

[Gumshoe] Umm... I guess, I haven't \ heard of many cases... no.

[Phoenix] Don't you find it a little \ odd that the victim would \ write down a name?

[Phoenix] Especially the name \ of her own sister?

[Gumshoe] Ah, yeah, actually, \ you got a point, pal.

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Stop right there.

[Edgeworth] The witness's opinion \ on the matter is irrelevant!

[Edgeworth] The facts are clear: the \ victim wrote down the \ name of the accused...

[Edgeworth] The victim told us \ the name of her killer!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Phoenix] (That didn't go so well...)

[Gumshoe] Th-that's right! \ What he said!

[Phoenix] (That's his whole \ testimony...)

[Phoenix] (Okay, there has to be \ a contradiction in there \ somewhere. Let's find it!)

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe!

[Phoenix] There's one thing I \ want you to clarify \ for me here.

[Phoenix] You say that the victim, \ Mia Fey, wrote this note.

[Phoenix] That she was accusing \ the defendant, Maya Fey?

[Phoenix] That's really what \ you're saying?

[Gumshoe] Wh-what? This isn't one \ of those lawyer tricks, \ now, is it?

[Gumshoe] Of course she wrote it! \ Who else could have!?

[Phoenix] You have it backwards, \ Detective.

[Gumshoe] B-backwards?

[Phoenix] The victim is the only \ person who absolutely \ could NOT have written t!

[Phoenix] This is a report from \ your department, Detective.

[Phoenix] "Immediate death due to a blow \ from a blunt object."

[Phoenix] She died immediately!

[Gumshoe] But...!

[Phoenix] No "but"-ing your way \ out of this one, Detective!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] The defense has a point.

[Judge] Someone who died immediately \ wouldn't have the time to \ write anything down.

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Mr. Wright.

[Edgeworth] I beg your pardon, but when \ exactly did you obtain that \ autopsy report?

[Phoenix] Wh-when...!?

***The day of the murder********************

[Phoenix] I... I'm pretty sure it \ was the day of the murder.

[Gumshoe] You're wrong there, pal!

[Gumshoe] We didn't write an autopsy \ report 'til the day after!

[Phoenix] Oh. Right.

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***The day after the murder*****************

[Phoenix] It was the day \ after the murder...

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***I forget*********************************

[Phoenix] I'm... sorry, I forgot.

[Edgeworth] Hah! \ Forgot, you say?

[Gumshoe] It was the day after the \ murder, Your Honor Sir.

[Gumshoe] I was the one who handed \ it to him myself! Personally!

[Phoenix] Oh. R-right.

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Judge] The prosecution's point \ being...?

[Edgeworth] That autopsy report \ is outdated, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] Wh-what!?

[Edgeworth] A second autopsy was \ performed yesterday, \ at my request!

[Edgeworth] "Death was almost immediate \ due to a blow from a \ blunt object..."

[Edgeworth] "But there is a possibility \ the victim lived for several \ minutes after the blow."

[Edgeworth] I received these results \ this morning.

[Phoenix] N-no way!

[Edgeworth] Your Honor!

[Edgeworth] It's quite easy to imagine \ that the victim did have \ time to write "Maya"!

[Edgeworth] That is all.

[Judge] I see!

[Phoenix] (Damn you, Edgeworth!)

[Phoenix] (I should have known \ you'd have something \ up your sleeve!)

[Edgeworth] Why, Mr. Wright, \ you look shocked!

[Edgeworth] Something you want to say?

***You're a sham, Edgeworth!****************

[Phoenix] Mr. Edgeworth...

[Phoenix] I've heard there's nothing \ you won't do to get \ your verdict...

[Phoenix] What reason could you possibly \ have had to request a second \ autopsy report?

[Judge] Mr. Wright! The defense will \ refrain from personal attacks \ on the prosecution!

[Edgeworth] No matter, Your Honor...

[Edgeworth] Mr. Wright.

[Edgeworth] Say what you will, \ the evidence in this \ report is undeniable.

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***The detective's a sham!******************

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe! \ You're a sham!

[Phoenix] How could you give \ me a faulty report!?

[Gumshoe] Huh? I-I thought...

[Edgeworth] Detective Gumshoe.

[Gumshoe] Urp!

[Edgeworth] I'm disappointed in you, \ handing him the wrong \ report like that.

[Gumshoe] Eh...? I... \ I'm sorry, sir.

[Edgeworth] You are at fault, Detective.

[Edgeworth] This isn't going to look good \ on your evaluation next month.

[Gumshoe] W-what? B-but... *sigh*

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***I'm a sham!******************************

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe.

[Phoenix] Are you calling me a fool \ because I believed your \ report?

[Gumshoe] Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh?

[Edgeworth] Detective Gumshoe.

[Gumshoe] Urp!

[Edgeworth] I'm disappointed in you, \ handing him the wrong \ report like that.

[Gumshoe] Eh...? I... \ I'm sorry, sir.

[Edgeworth] You are at fault, Detective.

[Edgeworth] This isn't going to look good \ on your evaluation next month.

[Gumshoe] W-what? B-but... *sigh*

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Edgeworth] Your Honor, I submit this \ report to the court.

[Judge] U-understood. The court \ accepts the evidence.

[] Autopsy Report updated \ in the Court Record.

[Edgeworth] Well, Your Honor?

[Edgeworth] The evidence strongly suggests \ the victim was identifying \ the killer.

[Judge] I suppose that's the \ obvious conclusion, yes.

[Phoenix] (Darn! This isn't good!)

[Edgeworth] The prosecution would like \ to call its next witness.

[Edgeworth] This poor, innocent girl saw \ the murder with her own eyes!

[Judge] Let the witness Miss April \ May take the stand.

[Phoenix] (Exactly what part of her \ is "innocent"...?)

[] ...

[Edgeworth] Witness, your name, please.

[April] April May! \ At your service! *wink*

[Judge] Order! An introduction should \ not require any reaction \ from the crowd!

[Judge] The witness will refrain \ from wonton winking!

[April] Aww... \ Yes, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] (This is not good...)

[Phoenix] (She's already captured \ the heart of every man \ in the court!)

[Edgeworth] Tell us, where were you on \ the night of September 5, \ when the murder occurred?

[April] Um... gee... I was, like, \ in my hotel room? Tee hee.

[April] I checked in right \ after lunch.

[Edgeworth] And this hotel is directly \ across from the Fey & Co. \ Law Offices?

[April] Mmm... that's right, big boy.

[Judge] Please testify to the court \ about what you saw.

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Witness's Account --

[April] (1) \ It was, like, 9:00 \ at night. I looked out \ the window, y'know!

[April] (2) \ And then, oooh! I saw a woman \ with long hair being attacked!

[April] (3) \ The one attacking her was \ the mousey girl sitting \ in the defendant's chair!

[April] (4) \ Then the woman, like, \ dodged to one side and \ ran away!

[April] (5) \ But that girl, she caught \ up to her and... and... \ She hit her!

[April] Then the woman \ with long hair...

[April] She kinda... slumped.

[April] The end. That's all I saw. \ Every little bitsy witsy! \ *wink*

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...

[Edgeworth] Well, Your Honor?

[Judge] I see. It is a remarkably \ solid testimony.

[Judge] I don't see a need to \ trouble the witness any...

[Phoenix] W-wait, Your Honor!

[Judge] Yes, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] What about my cross- \ examination!?

[Judge] I thought the witness's \ testimony just now was \ quite... firm. Didn't you?

[Edgeworth] Mr. Wright... I understand \ you were Ms. Mia Fey's \ understudy, were you not?

[Edgeworth] You must know her \ techniques well.

[Edgeworth] Her cowardly way of finding \ tiny faults in perfectly \ good testimonies...

[Phoenix] H-hey! How dare you!

[Judge] Well, Mr. Wright? \ Will you cross-examine \ the witness?

***Yes, I'm doing it************************

[Phoenix] I'll gladly proceed with \ the cross-examination.

[Phoenix] (If only because I have a \ feeling Edgeworth doesn't \ want me to!)

[Phoenix] (She has to have some \ weakness!)

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***No thanks********************************

[Phoenix] No... you're right. \ I guess there wouldn't \ be much point.

[Edgeworth] Heh heh heh. \ I'm glad you saw the error \ of your ways so soon!

[Edgeworth] Your Honor.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution rests its case!

[Phoenix] (Wh-what? That's it!?)

[Judge] Very well.

[Phoenix] W-wait! Hold on!

[Judge] Yes, Mr. Wright? \ Changed your mind? Will you \ cross-examine the witness?

[Phoenix] Yes yes yes!

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Witness's Account --

[April] (1) \ It was, like, 9:00 \ at night. I looked out \ the window, y'know!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Why did you do that?

[April] Huh? "Why"? \ Like, why what?

[Phoenix] Why did you look out the \ window? Were you expecting \ to see something?

[April] Oh, well, um... gee!

[Phoenix] (What? That's it? She can't \ get out of this question \ that easily!)

[April] I sort of, y'know.

[April] I had a feeling!

[Phoenix] (Well, I have a feeling \ she's trying to avoid \ the question!)

[Phoenix] (Maybe I should press a \ little harder on this one?)

***Go for it********************************

[Phoenix] (Let's see how far I can \ run with this...)

[Phoenix] Surely, you must have had \ a reason to look out your \ window at that time of night!

[April] I... oooh!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Mr. Wright! I will not have \ you badgering my witness!

[Phoenix] B-badgering?

[Edgeworth] You insist on needling her \ with these trivial questions.

[] (Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!)

[April] (2) \ And then, oooh! I saw a woman \ with long hair being attacked!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] The woman with long hair... \ that was Mia Fey?

[April] Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, \ well, some people might say \ pretty, if that's your thing.

[Phoenix] (Your... thing?)

[Edgeworth] And the person attacking her?

[April] (3) \ The one attacking her was \ the mousey girl sitting \ in the defendant's chair!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] How do you know she \ was the defendant?

[April] Huh? Well... y'know!

[April] S-she had a girlish physique. \ Women know these things.

[April] Look... I-I just know, okay?

[Edgeworth] There was only one person at \ the scene of the crime with \ a short, girlish figure.

[Edgeworth] The testimony is bulletproof, \ Your Honor.

[Phoenix] (He's right...)

***Yep, he's right**************************

[Phoenix] Okay...

[Phoenix] If you had really witnessed \ my client, Maya Fey...

[Phoenix] You would have noticed her \ clothes before noticing her \ physique!

[April] ...!

[Phoenix] No one wears clothes \ like this on a daily \ basis! Except her!

[Judge] Still, we don't know if \ she was dressed that way \ the night of the murder...

[Phoenix] She was, Your Honor!

[Phoenix] I saw her.

[Phoenix] And so did Detective Gumshoe!

[Phoenix] What do you say to that, \ Miss May?

[April] Rowr! \ What are you trying to say, \ you mean lawyer!

[April] I-I saw what I saw.

[April] I... just didn't think all \ the trifling little details \ were necessary, darling.

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Witness's Account --

[April] (1) \ I did see everything! \ I did!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So, you saw me then, too?

[April] Of course!

[April] I'd remember that \ spiky hair anywhere!

[Phoenix] (Spiky...?)

[Judge] The witness will refrain \ from personal attacks on \ the defense attorney.

[April] Aww, was I a bad girl? \ I'm sowwy.

[Judge] Very well... continue.

[April] (2) \ The victim--the woman--dodged \ the first attack and ran off \ to the right.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Is that "right" as in your \ right, as you looked from \ the hotel?

[April] Um... which hand do I \ hold my knife in again...?

[April] Right! It was my right \ hand! Right?

[Edgeworth] Satisfied, Mr. Wright? \ Please continue.

[April] (3) \ Then the girl in the hippie \ clothes ran after her...

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] How convenient for you \ to remember her "hippie" \ clothes!

[April] That's what you--I mean, \ that's what she was wearing!

[April] Oh, and her hair was all \ done up like a bun!

[Phoenix] (*sigh*...)

[Judge] What happened then?

[April] (4) \ And she hit her with that \ weapon! I saw it! I did!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Where did this weapon \ come from?

[April] She picked it up from the desk!

[Judge] I see. What sort \ of weapon was it?

[April] (5) \ That... that clock! Um... \ the kinda statue-y clock? \ "The Thinker," I think?

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] A... clock?

[Phoenix] (Didn't this come up \ in another testimony \ recently...?)

[April] W-well? Don't look so sour, \ Mr. Lawyer. You can't win \ them all.

[Phoenix] (No... but I have a feeling \ I'm on to something now!)

[Phoenix] Her previous testimony must \ have been what Edgeworth \ wanted her to say...)

[Phoenix] (So this was the testimony \ in her own words...?)

[Phoenix] (Time to press and squeeze \ the truth out of her! \ Figuratively, of course.)

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Miss May.

[Phoenix] What you said just now \ was quite... revealing.

[April] Revealing? Oooh, you'd \ like that, wouldn't you. \ Naughty Mr. Lawyer...

[Phoenix] You just said that this \ statue of "The Thinker" \ was a clock.

[Phoenix] But there's no way of \ knowing that just by \ looking at it!

[April] Urp!

[Phoenix] Another person in much the \ same position as you recently \ called this a "clock," too...

[Phoenix] And he was found \ guilty... of murder!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Phoenix] Miss May. Can you explain \ how you know this was a clock?

[April] Oooh... urp!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] The witness saw the murder \ with her own eyes! That's \ all that's important here!

[Edgeworth] The defense is trying to \ confuse the issue with \ trivial concerns!

[Judge] Yes... yes, of course. \ You will withdraw your \ question, Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] But questions are all \ I have, Your Honor!

[Phoenix] And as you may recall, \ I've caught murderers with \ these questions before!

[Phoenix] (Well, only once...)

[Judge] ...

[Judge] ...

[Judge] Objection sustained. \ You may continue to question \ the witness.

[Phoenix] (Whew, that was close.)

[Phoenix] (If he stopped me there, \ the trial would be over!)

[April] Huh? What? \ So... what happens now?

[Phoenix] What happens now is you \ answer my question! How \ did you know it was a clock?

[April] What...! Th-that's...

[April] ...Because... I heard it?

[April] Yes! I heard \ it say the time!

[Phoenix] So, you've been to the \ law offices of Fey & Co.!

[April] N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say \ that! Why would I go there!

[April] I heard from my hotel room. \ Hee hee!

[Edgeworth] The law offices of Fey & Co., \ where the murder took place, \ are very close to the hotel.

[Edgeworth] She could easily have \ heard the clock!

[Judge] Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? \ Are you satisfied?

[Phoenix] No, Your Honor!

[Phoenix] (I can't give up now!)

[Phoenix] I'm not satisfied because...

***She couldn't have heard it***************

[Phoenix] You were at the hotel!

[Phoenix] There's no way you could have \ heard a clock go off in the \ building next door!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] You have proof that \ she could not?

[Phoenix] Uh...

[Edgeworth] Amateurs, amateurs. \ Listen to me, Mr. Wright.

[Edgeworth] In the courtroom, proof is \ everything. Without it, you \ have nothing. You ARE nothing.

[Phoenix] Then I would like to propose \ a test to see if she really \ could have heard...

[Edgeworth] The prosecution denies \ your request!

[Phoenix] Wh-what!? On what grounds?

[Edgeworth] This is a trivial matter \ with no direct bearing \ on the case at hand!

[Judge] Indeed. \ Objection sustained.

[Phoenix] (Damn! Time to switch \ directions... quick!)

[Judge] Ready to proceed, \ Mr. Wright?

[Judge] Would you care to explain \ to the court the meaning \ of this?

[Phoenix] It is as you can see.

[Phoenix] The "clock" was empty. \ It couldn't have rung!

[Phoenix] Therefore, this \ witness...

[Phoenix] is a big, fat liar!

[April] F-fat!?

[Phoenix] Well, Miss May?

[Edgeworth] Tsk tsk.

[Phoenix] ?

[Edgeworth] Quite a show you've \ put on for us, Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] (He knew the clock was empty! \ Somehow... he knew!)

[Edgeworth] I'm afraid you've forgotten \ one thing, however.

[Edgeworth] Indeed, the clock is empty. \ As you say... it can't ring.

[Edgeworth] However, we must ask: when \ was the clockwork removed?

[Edgeworth] If it was after the witness \ heard the clock, then there \ is no contradiction!

[Judge] !

[Judge] Hmm! That's true. That \ is a possibility.

[Judge] The clock might have been \ emptied after she heard it.

[Edgeworth] And that is exactly what \ happened, Your Honor!

[Judge] Well, Mr. Wright?

[Judge] Can you prove when \ the clockwork was removed?

[Edgeworth] Ho hoh! \ Impossible, of course...

[Phoenix] I have proof.

[Edgeworth] W-what!?

[Phoenix] Wasn't it you who told \ me "proof is everything"?

[Phoenix] Well, I was listening.

[Phoenix] And now I'll show you the \ "proof" you like so much!

[Phoenix] The evidence that proves \ when the clockwork was \ removed is...

***Present something wrong******************

[April] W-what? I don't rightly \ understand what that's \ supposed to mean!

[Judge] I don't rightly \ understand either.

***You held it******************************

[Phoenix] (This is familiar territory. \ I'll just use the same \ approach as with Larry.)

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] Mr. Wright! What is \ the meaning of this!?

[Phoenix] April May, you killed \ Mia Fey, I say!

[Edgeworth] You truly are a work \ of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.

[Phoenix] W-what's that supposed \ to mean!?

[Edgeworth] It was you who just proved \ that "The Thinker" was \ empty!

[Phoenix] Oh... \ (Urk! Of course it \ wouldn't ring!)

[Edgeworth] What's more, the witness \ has a rock-solid alibi.

[Edgeworth] Miss May?

[Edgeworth] Perhaps you could explain \ to the poor, misguided \ Mr. Wright?

[Edgeworth] You were in the hotel \ at the time of the murder.

[Phoenix] (S-she can't prove it! \ She did it!)

[April] It would be MY pleasure!

[Phoenix] N-no way!

[April] Yes way, Mr. Lawyer.

[April] Tee hee? Didn't the murder \ take place at 9:00 at night?

[April] Gee, that's the exact time \ I ordered some room service \ from the hotel bellboy!

[Edgeworth] Incidentally, the bellboy \ corroborates the witness's \ story.

[Edgeworth] Ergo, she was not at the \ crime scene! Rock solid!

[Judge] Mr. Wright! You've just made \ a serious accusation to a \ perfectly innocent woman!

[Phoenix] S-sorry, Your Honor. \ (That... didn't go so well.)

[Phoenix] (But, if that's the case...)

[Phoenix] (Then how did she know \ "The Thinker" was a clock!?)

[Phoenix] (...)

[Phoenix] (Wait!)

[Phoenix] There is one other way \ Miss April May could have \ known it was a clock!

[Phoenix] One way alone! \ And I have proof!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] I object to calling \ the bellboy!

[Phoenix] W-why? \ What's your reason?

[Edgeworth] Because I hold that the \ wiretapping had nothing to \ do with the killing!

[Phoenix] ...!

[Edgeworth] However...

[Edgeworth] If you agree to one condition, \ I'll consent to calling this \ witness.

[Phoenix] Condition...?

[Edgeworth] If Miss April May's alibi is \ not called into question after \ you examine the bellboy...

[Edgeworth] Then you will recognize that \ Miss April May was not the \ killer, thus she is innocent!

[Edgeworth] Therefore you must accept \ the verdict of "guilty" \ for Ms. Maya Fey!

[Edgeworth] That is my condition.

[Phoenix] (What...!?)

[Phoenix] (I'd better find something \ suspicious in that bellboy's \ testimony...)

[Phoenix] (Otherwise Maya will be \ declared "guilty" on the \ spot!)

[Phoenix] (What should I do...?)

***Accept the condition*********************

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Alright! I've got nothing \ * to lose! Except for... \ * well, everything!)

[] * -Phoenix \ * Understood. \ * I accept your condition.

[] * -Edgeworth \ * Hmph.

[] * -Edgeworth \ * Fool... \ * You fell right into my trap!

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Uh oh!)

[] * -Phoenix \ * Uh... um, wait...

********************************************

***Give up**********************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Grr! I can't accept \ * those conditions!)

[] * -Phoenix \ * Very well. The defense \ * will refrain from calling \ * the bellboy as a witness.

[] * -Judge \ * I see. You may continue your \ * cross-examination, Mr. Wright.

[] * -Phoenix \ * Right. On with the \ * cross-examination.

[] * JUMP TO "Continue examining Miss May"

********************************************

********************************************

***Continue examining Miss May**************

[Phoenix] Right. On with the \ cross-examination.

[Edgeworth] What exactly do you \ have left to examine, \ Mr. Wright?

[Edgeworth] Miss April May has admitted \ to the wiretap, yes.

[Edgeworth] But that bears no relevance \ to the case at hand: murder!

[Edgeworth] There's no way you can \ prove any connection!

[Phoenix] (Uh oh! Think! This can't \ be the end... but I'm out \ of evidence!)

[Judge] Then I believe the cross- \ examination is over.

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth, \ does the prosecution have \ any other witnesses to call?

[Edgeworth] None, Your Honor. \ She's the last.

[Phoenix] (What!? B-but that means...)

[Phoenix] (Maya's guilty...!?)

[Phoenix] W-wait! Your Honor!

[Judge] Yes, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] The defense would like to \ call the bellboy after all!

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Tsk tsk tsk...

[Edgeworth] As I thought!

[Phoenix] ...?

[Edgeworth] May I remind you, dear \ Mr. Wright. Should you \ question the bellboy...

[Edgeworth] and Miss April May's \ alibi prove to be solid...

[Edgeworth] then, by default, your client \ Ms. Maya Fey will be \ pronounced "guilty"!

[Edgeworth] Are you prepared to \ accept my condition?

[Phoenix] (Edgeworth...)

[Phoenix] (He's got me backed \ into a corner...)

[Phoenix] (But I don't see any \ other way to take this!)

[Phoenix] I accept!

********************************************

[Judge] Very well!

[Judge] The court calls the hotel \ bellboy to the stand!

[] ...

[Edgeworth] I believe we're ready \ for the witness to testify.

[Edgeworth] He certainly does look \ like a bellboy.

[Bellboy] Yes, sir.

[Bellboy] I received your summons in \ the middle of work, sir. \ I'm happy to be of service.

[Judge] That tea set looks rather \ heavy, so without further ado,

[Judge] the witness may begin \ his testimony.

[Bellboy] Very good, sir!

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Miss May's Room Service --

[Bellboy] (1) \ I am the head bellboy at the \ fine Gatewater Hotel, in \ business for four generations!

[Bellboy] (2) \ I believe I received a call \ after 8:00 in the evening \ from our guest, Miss May.

[Bellboy] (3) \ She asked for an ice coffee \ to be brought to her at \ 9:00, on the dot, sir.

[Bellboy] (4) \ I brought it to her at \ precisely the requested \ time, of course.

[Bellboy] (5) \ And I delivered the ice \ coffee to our guest Miss \ May, herself.

[] ...

[Judge] I see. \ The defense may begin \ its cross-examination.

[Phoenix] R-right! \ I'm ready. (I hope...)

[Phoenix] (This is it...)

[Phoenix] (If I can't prove Miss May \ was involved with the \ murder now...)

[Phoenix] (Maya will be finished!)

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Miss May's Room Service --

[Bellboy] (1) \ I am the head bellboy at the \ fine Gatewater Hotel, in \ business for four generations!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What exactly is it you \ do at the hotel?

[Bellboy] Why, anything required \ of me, sir.

[Bellboy] I check in guests, \ I check out guests.

[Bellboy] I clean rooms, \ I make beds.

[Bellboy] I even deliver room \ service, sir.

[Bellboy] I checked Miss May in \ personally.

[Phoenix] Are you always \ so... so prim?

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Judge] You will refrain from asking \ frivolous questions...

[Bellboy] (2) \ I believe I received a call \ after 8:00 in the evening \ from our guest, Miss May.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Are you sure it was \ Miss May on the phone?

[Bellboy] Absolutely, sir.

[Phoenix] H-how can you be so certain!?

[Bellboy] I checked Miss May in \ personally, sir.

[Bellboy] Not only did I see her in \ all her stunning radiance, \ but I also heard her voice.

[Bellboy] And then I saw THEM, \ and I...

[Bellboy] Ahem. Er... ahem!

[Bellboy] The point being, I remembered \ her quite well, sir.

[Judge] Yes, what then?

[Bellboy] (3) \ She asked for an ice coffee \ to be brought to her at \ 9:00, on the dot, sir.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] 9:00 "on the dot," \ you say?

[Bellboy] Yes. I confirmed that \ detail several times.

[Bellboy] She was watching a program \ on the TV, and wished to \ drink after she finished, sir.

[Phoenix] (9:00... the time \ of the murder!)

[Bellboy] (4) \ I brought it to her at \ precisely the requested \ time, of course.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "Precisely" 9:00, then?

[Bellboy] Precisely, exactly, and \ most definitely, sir, \ 9:00 PM.

[Phoenix] How can you be so sure!?

[Bellboy] Miss May was quite \ insistent that it \ be brought then.

[Bellboy] "Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! \ I'd like, like, ice coffee \ at exactly 9:00!"

[Bellboy] Something like that, sir.

[Bellboy] Therefore, I knocked on \ her door at the crack \ of 9:00, sir.

[Phoenix] (Why would she be so \ particular about the time?)

[Bellboy] (5) \ And I delivered the ice \ coffee to our guest Miss \ May, herself.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] You are sure it was \ Miss April May herself?

[Bellboy] Ab-SO-lutely, sir.

[Phoenix] "Ab-SO-lutely"...?

[Bellboy] Yes, sir. As n, "so very \ absolutely," sir. It's an \ endearing mannerism of mine.

[Phoenix] How come you're \ so very certain!?

[Bellboy] Well, when I brought \ the room service, sir...

[Bellboy] S-she... the guest, sir, \ favored me w-with a, um, \ an "embrasser," sir.

[Phoenix] "Embrasser"!? Is that \ French for "embrace"?

[Bellboy] It's French for "kiss," sir. \ But not a french kiss, sir! \ More of a peck on the cheek.

[Phoenix] Wh-why would she \ have done that...?

[Bellboy] I believe, perhaps, she \ was momentarily swayed by \ my prim demeanor, sir.

[Bellboy] It was a moment I shall \ never, ever forget, sir.

[Phoenix] (Sounds pretty fishy to me...)

[Phoenix] (I think our Miss May was up \ to something and wanted the \ bellboy to remember her!)

[Phoenix] (This bellboy wouldn't \ have any reason to lie...)

[Phoenix] (But I have to find \ something to use in \ his testimony!)

[Phoenix] (One more time. I'll press him \ until he spills the beans... \ or his tea!)

[] ...

[] AFTER PRESSING EVERY DETAIL

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] It's no good! \ (There's nothing there!)

[Phoenix] (Is... is that it!?)

[Edgeworth] Tsk tsk.

[Edgeworth] Finally, you understand.

[Edgeworth] This bellboy has absolutely \ no reason to lie!

[Edgeworth] Now...

[Edgeworth] If you have any decency, you \ will end this rather tedious \ cross-examination here!

[Judge] Hmm. It was a bit tedious.

[Judge] The witness may leave \ the stand.

[Phoenix] (I can't let this \ happen... can I?)

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Your Honor, I must object.

[Edgeworth] This charade of justice \ has gone on long enough!

[Judge] Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth.

[Judge] Alright Mr. Wright. \ I'll give you one more \ question, that's all.

[Phoenix] (Okay.)

[Phoenix] (This is really it, now. \ This is my last chance!)

[Phoenix] (What do I ask him about...!?)

***Check-in*********************************

[Phoenix] T-tell me about \ check-in!

[Phoenix] Tell me about when you \ checked-in Miss May.

[Bellboy] Oh, alright. \ Very well, sir.

[Bellboy] My first thought was \ that she was a beautiful, \ beautiful person.

[Bellboy] She's just my type of girl, \ so it was a disappointment, \ really.

[Phoenix] I see...

[Phoenix] ?

[Phoenix] Excuse me... what exactly \ was a "disappointment"?

[Bellboy] Well, I am not without charm, \ sir, but even I'd have little \ chance with her lover there.

[Phoenix] (...!)

[Phoenix] (What did he say!?)

[Phoenix] What did you say!?

[Bellboy] Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!

[Phoenix] Bellboy! Tell us the \ truth now...

[Phoenix] Did Miss May check in \ with another person?

***Room service*****************************

[Phoenix] T-tell me again about \ er... room service!

[Bellboy] A-again, sir?

[Bellboy] At exactly 9:00, \ I delivered room service \ to Miss May in room 303.

[Bellboy] The guest had requested \ ice coffee... $18 was the \ charge, as I recall.

[Phoenix] I see...

[Phoenix] ...?

[Phoenix] E-eighteen dollars? \ Doesn't that seem a bit \ expensive?

[Bellboy] Y-yes, well, ice coffee \ for two, you know. And we \ don't skimp on the ice, sir.

[Phoenix] (...!)

[Phoenix] (What did he say!?)

[Phoenix] What did you say!?

[Bellboy] Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!

***Bed making*******************************

[Phoenix] Bed... bed making!

[Phoenix] Tell me about making \ beds that day.

[Edgeworth] I was wondering what you \ were going to ask, but \ bed making? A new low!

[Judge] Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth.

[Judge] The witness will answer \ the defense's question.

[Bellboy] Yes, well, it was quite like \ any other day's bed making.

[Bellboy] I changed the sheets, the \ pillowcases, and then I \ proceeded to make the bed.

[Bellboy] I had to bring pillows for \ two, of course, but they're \ quite light, you see.

[Phoenix] I see. \ Thank you.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] (Pillows... for two!?)

[Phoenix] Bellboy! What did you \ just say?

[Bellboy] Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows \ are light... sir?

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] I object! That was... \ objectionable!

[Judge] Objection overruled. \ The witness will answer \ the question.

[Bellboy] Er... yes, I see.

[Phoenix] Why did you not mention \ this in your testimony!?

[Bellboy] W-well, sir, you er... \ you didn't ask!

[Phoenix] (Nice try!)

[Phoenix] That's the sort of thing \ you're normally supposed \ to mention!

[Bellboy] Ah, yes, quite. \ Indeed...

[Bellboy] It was the, er, good \ barrister there, \ Mr. Edgeworth, who...

[Phoenix] !

[Bellboy] He asked me not to mention \ it if I wasn't specifically \ asked, sir.

[Edgeworth] Oof!

[Edgeworth] Y-you fool!

[] ...

[Phoenix] I've done it... I've won!

[] ...

[Phoenix] Miss April May checked into \ a twin room... with a man.

[Phoenix] Correct?

[Bellboy] Yes, sir.

[Phoenix] Then, when you brought \ them room service,

[Phoenix] you didn't see that \ man in the room...?

[Bellboy] That's right, sir.

[Judge] Hmm...

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] We have just learned of \ another person involved who \ may have been the murderer!

[Phoenix] In this new light, I hold \ that it's impossible to judge \ the defendant.

[Phoenix] You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?

[Edgeworth] Who! Who is this \ "other person"!

[Phoenix] Simple, it was...

***Miss April May***************************

[Phoenix] None other than \ Miss April May!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Eh!?

[Edgeworth] Your Honor, Mr. Wright...

[Edgeworth] It was the bellboy who \ confirmed Miss May's \ alibi...

[Edgeworth] And this in turn confirms \ the bellboy's alibi! \ He was in the hotel!

[Phoenix] Well, s-sure... \ if you put it that way...

[Edgeworth] I do put it that way, \ and I trust you will too!

[Phoenix] But what if they \ were in cahoots!

[Judge] You have evidence of this?

[Phoenix] Um... no, Your Honor.

[Judge] Mr. Wright!

[Phoenix] S-sorry, Your Honor! \ Give me one more chance!

[] RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

[Phoenix] The man who checked in \ with Miss May!

[Edgeworth] Oof!

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] As has been previously \ revealed, Miss April May was \ tapping the victim's phone.

[Phoenix] Yet Miss May herself has \ an alibi at the time of \ the murder.

[Phoenix] However, that does not \ clear the man that was \ with her!

[Phoenix] The bellboy saw no one \ else in the room at the \ time of the murder!!!

[Edgeworth] M-my, what a convenient \ little setup... but it's \ too late...

[Phoenix] "Too late"?

[Phoenix] I suppose you'd like it \ if it was too late, \ wouldn't you...

[Phoenix] After all, it was you who \ hid the presence of the \ other man from this court!

[Edgeworth] Oof!

[Edgeworth] Upstart... amateur...!

[Edgeworth] T-these accusations are... \ ludicrous!

[Judge] Enough!

[Judge] The court acknowledges the \ defense's argument.

[Judge] I expect the prosecution \ and defense to look into \ this matter fully!

[Judge] Am I understood?

[Edgeworth] Yes... *gasp* \ Yes, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] Oh, I was just "doing \ my job" you know... heh heh.

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Maya] It sent shivers \ up my spine!

[Phoenix] Hmm... if you say so.

[Maya] So, what happens with me?

[Maya] Do I get to go home now?

[Phoenix] Well, no.

[Phoenix] I don't think so. \ Not yet.

[Maya] Oh... I see.

[Phoenix] But I got a great lead \ in today's trial!

[Maya] A "lead"?

[Phoenix] That man with Miss May! \ He's the key!

[Maya] Oh! I get it.

[Maya] What happened to Miss May \ after that, anyway?

[Phoenix] I heard they arrested her. \ I guess she's learning her \ charms won't work everywhere.

[Phoenix] She's probably at the \ detention center now. I may \ have to go down there later.

[Phoenix] Anyway.

[Phoenix] This case is far from closed.

[Maya] Yes sir!

[Phoenix] I'm going to find out \ more about this man.

[Maya] Do you think he was \ the one who...?

[Phoenix] Maybe so.

[Maya] Sis...

[Phoenix] Don't worry, I'll find \ him by tomorrow. I promise.

[Maya] I'm counting on you!

[] ...

[Phoenix] I asked for a full record of \ April May's testimony.

[Phoenix] I thought it might come in \ handy during the trial \ tomorrow.

[Phoenix] But now that I have it, \ I'm not so sure.

[Phoenix] Most of her testimony \ was all lies...

[Phoenix] In fact, there's only \ one part that got left \ on the record.

[] May Testimony added \ to the Court Record.

[Phoenix] I don't know how much \ good this will do me \ at all, now.

[Phoenix] Anyway, time to hit \ the pavement and do \ some investigating!

[Phoenix] What about this photo?

[Bellboy] Well, it's a fine photo, sir.

[Bellboy] However, the person \ Miss May was accompanied \ by was, well, a man.

[Phoenix] (Oh... yeah. Right.)

********************************************

***Present Photograph (man)*****************

[Phoenix] Take a look at this photo.

[Bellboy] ...

[Bellboy] That's him, Detective.

[Phoenix] Um... I'm the lawyer.

[Bellboy] Oh, I know that!

[Bellboy] I just wanted to say \ "Detective" once. \ You know how it is.

[Phoenix] (No. No I don't.)

[Bellboy] Without a doubt, that is the \ man who checked in with \ Miss April May.

[Bellboy] How about I write an affidavit \ swearing that that's him!

[Phoenix] An affidavit? \ (This guy is way too \ excited about this...)

***Have him write it************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * Well, sure. Why not?

[] * -Bellboy \ * Yes!

[] * -Bellboy \ * I've always wanted to \ * write an affidavit, sir.

[] * -Bellboy \ * From hence forth I will \ * be known as the "bellboy \ * who swore the affidavit"!

[] * -Phoenix \ * Just hurry up and write it.

[Phoenix] Thanks for this.

[Bellboy] No no no, not at all, sir!

[April] YOU AGAIN!? \ Can't you take a hint \ and stay gone?

[Phoenix] Hey, the only reason I'm \ back here is because YOU \ won't talk to me!

[April] Oh, so it's MY fault now?

[April] You don't just have spiky \ hair, you also have a \ spiky heart.

[Phoenix] (That does it. When this case \ is done I'm shaving my head.)

***Talk about "That "man""******************

[Phoenix] About the man who stayed \ with you in your hotel room...

[Phoenix] Can you tell me about him? \ Where is he?

[April] I'm not telling!

[Phoenix] Look, he's being accused of \ murder! I don't think you \ want to be protecting him.

[April] Hmm. Would you have sold \ out the late Ms. Fey to \ the cops?

[Phoenix] No.

[April] See?

[Phoenix] (Damn!)

[April] !

[April] Where did you...?

[Phoenix] (Ah hah! A reaction!)

[Phoenix] This is him, isn't it?

[April] What? Who? When? Why...?

[Phoenix] It IS him.

[Phoenix] This is the man who stayed \ in your hotel room the night \ of the murder!

[April] No! No, that's not right.

[Phoenix] (Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)

[April] ...!

[] * -Phoenix \ * Miss May...

[] * -April \ * ...

[] * -Phoenix \ * If they get involved, wouldn't \ * your boss be even more... \ * er... inconvenienced?

[] * -Phoenix \ * All I want to do is have \ * a little chat with him.

[] * -Phoenix \ * You won't tell me?

[] * -April \ * ...

[] * -April \ * Is that all you have to say?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Yes.

[] * -April \ * It it's so easy for you to \ * "get the police involved," \ * then why don't you?

[] * -April \ * Somehow I think you're \ * not up to it, hmm?

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Show them a little kindness \ * and they jump all over you!)

[] * -Phoenix \ * No use playing dumb! \ * (If, indeed, that's an act.)

[] * -April \ * Whaaaaat!?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Even though he should be a \ * witness to murder, this man \ * is in hiding.

[] * -Phoenix \ * I'm sure the press would \ * have a field day with his \ * reputation!

[] * -April \ * ...!

[] * -April \ * Ooooh! \ * Fine! I'll talk!

[Phoenix] (Alright, this is getting \ ridiculous. Where the heck \ is that loafer?)

[Grossberg] *Ah-HHHHEM!*

[Phoenix] (Ah, that old familiar \ clearing of the throat...)

[Grossberg] Ah hah! You again.

[Phoenix] Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg.

[Grossberg] ...

[Grossberg] Well, well.

[Grossberg] You were quite the \ thing, my boy.

[Phoenix] Excuse me...?

[Grossberg] The trial! The trial!

[Phoenix] (He was there...?)

[Grossberg] Reminded me of myself \ when I was a youth!

[Phoenix] (I guess something got passed \ down through Mia... maybe?)

[Grossberg] It brings back \ memories, it does!

[Grossberg] "Ah... the days of my youth... \ like the scent of fresh \ lemon..." you see.

[Grossberg] ...

[Grossberg] I apologize.

[Phoenix] ?

[Grossberg] I... It was all a bit \ too much for me, my boy.

[Grossberg] Seeing you today, \ I... well, I...

[Grossberg] ...

[Phoenix] (I appreciate the reminiscing, \ but I'd much rather you gave \ me some information!)

[] ...

***Talk about "Today's trial"***************

[Phoenix] So you came to \ see the trial?

[Grossberg] Yes, yes I did.

[Grossberg] Something was bothering me \ all last night, you see. I \ couldn't get a wink of sleep.

[Phoenix] Really? What was that?

[Grossberg] Well, you see, it's just... \ Mia's sister, that poor girl.

[Grossberg] My boy, I owe you \ my thanks, truly.

[Grossberg] I don't know what I would \ have done if things had \ gone poorly for the girl.

[Phoenix] (If you were that worried \ about it, why didn't you \ offer to defend her!?)

********************************************

***Talk about "Your refusal"****************

[Phoenix] I asked before, but, why \ did you refuse her request \ for defense?

[Phoenix] I think I have \ a right to know.

[Grossberg] A right, Mr. Wright?

[Grossberg] No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, \ I need more time to think \ about it, my boy.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] (He does seem troubled \ about something...)

[Phoenix] (Maybe I can find something \ that will inspire him to \ talk.)

********************************************

***Talk about "That painting"***************

[Phoenix] The other day I'm sure there \ was a big, pretentious-looking \ painting on that wall...

[Grossberg] "Pretentious-looking"...?

[Phoenix] Well... you know \ the one I mean.

[Phoenix] Anyway, where did it go?

[Grossberg] Ah, yes, well...

[Grossberg] I... got rid of it. Got quite \ tired of the thing, really.

[Grossberg] I, er, sold it, you see. \ Yes, that's right.

[Phoenix] (Sold it!? \ I'm not sure I buy that...)

[Phoenix] Wasn't that painting rather \ important to you, sir?

[Phoenix] Did something happen?

[Grossberg] I don't see how it's \ any of your business!

[Grossberg] Please, speak no more \ of that accursed painting.

[Grossberg] I didn't... \ I...

[] * -Phoenix \ * I'm sorry to have taken \ * it without your knowledge.

[] * -Phoenix \ * But... I have to know. \ * Who is this man?

[] * -Phoenix \ * He was most likely in \ * April May's room the \ * night of the murder.

[] * -Grossberg \ * ! \ * What's that you say!?

[] * -Grossberg \ * A-are you QUITE sure? \ * My boy?

[] * -Phoenix \ * (What has him so flustered \ * I wonder...?)

[] * -Grossberg \ * I... I beg your pardon, but \ * I must ask you to leave.

[] * -Grossberg \ * I need to be alone.

[] * -Phoenix \ * (...!)

[] * -Phoenix \ * (He's fallen silent \ * as a stone. A rather \ * large stone.)

[] * -Phoenix \ * (I guess I should \ * return that photo.)

[] * Returned photograph to \ * Mr. Grossberg.

***If you "eased April's fears"*************

[] * -Grossberg \ * ...! \ * Where did you get that!?

[] * -Phoenix \ * I borrowed it.

[] * -Grossberg \ * Well, give it back at once!

[] * -Phoenix \ * Mr. Grossberg. \ * Tell me about the man \ * in this photo.

[] * -Phoenix \ * He may have been in that hotel \ * room with April May on the \ * night of the murder.

[] * -Phoenix \ * Do you know something \ * about him... anything?

[] * -Grossberg \ * ...!

[] * -Grossberg \ * Hmm. Ahem!

[] * -Grossberg \ * Very well. \ * I'll tell you what I know.

[] * -Grossberg \ * However...

[] * -Grossberg \ * You didn't hear it \ * from me, if you follow.

[] * -Phoenix \ * I follow.

[] * -Grossberg \ * That man is Mr. Redd White.

[] * -Grossberg \ * He's the President of Bluecorp.

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Redd White... Hmm.)

[] * -Phoenix \ * Bluecorp... they're something \ * like a detective agency, right?

[] * -Grossberg \ * They're information pros. \ * They sell information, you see. \ * Sensitive information.

[] * -Grossberg \ * Despite his name, Mr. White \ * has the blackest reputation \ * of any man in this country.

[] * -Grossberg \ * Should you run across him, \ * watch what you say.

[] * -Grossberg \ * You wouldn't want him digging \ * up any dirt on you.

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Hmm... selling information. \ * Sounds like blackmail.)

[] * -Phoenix \ * Can you tell me where \ * Bluecorp is located?

[] * -Grossberg \ * Hmm... \ * I suppose.

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Mr. Redd White, at last!)

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Finally, a lead on this guy!)

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Even if April May couldn't \ * have done it, he could have!)

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Time to take action!)

[Phoenix] (What the...?)

[White] Your name! \ What's your name?

[White] I was just inquirably asking \ the title that you go by.

[Phoenix] Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. \ ("Inquirably"...?)

[White] Mr. Wright, is it? \ Right, I see...

[White] Splendiferous.

[White] Perhaps I have intimidated \ you with my giantesque \ vocabulary...?

[Phoenix] (What is this guy's problem!)

[White] I'm Redd White, CEO of \ Bluecorp. You know, \ Corporate Expansion Official?

[White] My business dealings \ bring me into contact with \ the elite of the elite.

[] White \ So I'm afraid I am not \ used to conversing with the \ wordily-challenged.

[Phoenix] (What a fruitcake!)

[White] Hmmm, let me guess...

[White] You are an attorney fresh out \ of law school, are you not?

[White] That's the only explanation \ for why you would come to \ meet me like this!

[Phoenix] (What does he mean by that?)

[White] No matter.

[White] So, what business does a \ "mighty" lawyer have with \ a man such as myself?

[Phoenix] (Yipes! This guy's arrogance \ meter is off the scale!)

[] ...

***Examine window***************************

[Phoenix] This is the top floor \ of a 20-story building.

[Phoenix] The view is quite... \ presidential.

********************************************

***Examine painting*************************

[Phoenix] ...?

[Phoenix] Haven't I seen this \ somewhere...? \ Is this a replica?

[White] Ridiculosity! I have no \ interest in anything but \ originals.

[White] That right there is a bona \ fide original! Worth five \ million, for sure.

[Phoenix] Hmmm...

********************************************

***Examine desk*****************************

[Phoenix] I'm guessing this is \ supposed to be a desk?

[Phoenix] My my... \ This is quite the... thing.

[] END IF TOLD TO LEAVE

[White] It is modeled on my body, see?

[White] Well? Does its sleek \ roundature not... inspire you?

********************************************

***Examine trophies*************************

[Phoenix] An impressive line-up \ of trophies.

[Phoenix] "Judges Special Runner-up" \ "Best Participation"

[Phoenix] "Judges Cooperation Award" \ "Special Good Try Prize"

[Phoenix] Hmm. The words "Judges" and \ "Special" kind of stand out.

[] CONTINUE IF TOLD TO LEAVE

[Phoenix] He probably strong-armed \ them into giving him \ something.

[Phoenix] A statue of a man holding \ up the world.

[Phoenix] The "Bluecorp" sign certainly \ stands out enough...

[Phoenix] The model for the man is, \ of course, Mr. White.

[White] Truly a work of art! But, \ probably to beautacious for \ you to appreciate, correct?

********************************************

***Present Wiretap**************************

[Phoenix] About this wiretap...

[White] Ah, the one that Miss May \ used, right?

[White] Bad girl. Bad, bad girl.

[Phoenix] She testified that she placed \ the wiretap at your request.

[White] How pathetic. I guess she's \ trying to pass the buck.

[White] Bad, bad girl.

[White] Sorry I can't help you. \ I know nothing.

[Phoenix] (I'm going to need hard \ evidence to get anything \ out of this guy...)

********************************************

***Present other****************************

[White] I am terribly sorry.

[White] But that really doesn't seem \ to concern me at all.

********************************************

***Talk about "Miss May"********************

[Phoenix] Miss May is an employee of \ Bluecorp, is she not?

[White] Correct. \ She was my secretariat.

[White] What a shock it was to \ hear what she has done!

[Phoenix] "What she has done"... \ You mean the wiretap?

[White] Indeed! She is paid to \ answer phones. Tapping them \ is NOT in her job description.

[White] She does gather information \ for us as part of her duties.

[White] But, I assure you, we do \ not condone illegal methods!

[White] It is ineffable that \ she would do this.

[Phoenix] (It sounds like he's \ trying to turn Miss May \ into a scapegoat...)

********************************************

***Talk about "Night of the murder"*********

[Phoenix] On the night of the murder \ were you in April May's \ hotel room?

[White] Who can say? I seldom pay \ attention to mundane details \ such as time and place.

[White] My motto is: \ "Don't worry, be happy!"

[Phoenix] Still, Mr. White...

[Phoenix] The hotel bellboy has stated \ on the record that he does \ remember you very clearly.

[White] ...

[White] No matter! The bellboy \ can say what he pleases. \ I still won't talk to you.

[White] If you want me to speak, \ put me on the witness stand!

[White] Although I doubt you'd be \ capable of doing that.

[Phoenix] (Hmm. He raises a good \ question, actually...)

[Phoenix] (Why didn't prosecution \ call him as a witness?)

[Phoenix] (He should have "seen" the \ same thing as April May!)

[White] Oh hoh hoh.

[White] The police... the courts...

[White] To me they are mere toys. \ Playthings for my amusement!

********************************************

***Talk about "Bluecorp"********************

[Phoenix] What kind of company \ is Bluecorp, anyway?

[White] Ah, excellent question!

[White] We buy and sell various \ kinds of information.

[White] We are the company of the \ future! You might say, \ we ARE the future!

[Phoenix] (Sell... information?)

[White] In just 10 years, I've built \ this business up into the \ grand office you see now.

[White] Ah, in case you were \ wondering, Bluecorp was \ named after the color "blue"!

[White] I, Redd White of Bluecorp, \ as founder and CEO, named \ it so!

[White] And why, you ask? Because I \ like the color blue of course!

[White] Fantabulistic, is it not?

********************************************

***Talk about "That painting"***************

[Phoenix] Uh... there's something \ that's been bothering me.

[White] Yes? What might that be?

[Phoenix] That big painting on \ the wall over there...

***When did you get it?*********************

[] * -Phoenix \ * Say, when did you \ * get that painting?

[] * -White \ * ...

[White] No, my feeble friend. \ A "mere" lawyer.

[Phoenix] (Wh-what!?)

[Phoenix] Ungh! Oof...!

[Phoenix] Unh... uhhh... \ (He... he punched me!)

[White] Well, Mr. Lawyer. \ What will you do, eh? \ Charge me with assault?

[White] Charge away, I welcome it! \ For it is YOU who will \ be found guilty!

[Phoenix] What...?

[White] Heed my exposition! \ The police, the courts, \ they all do my bidding.

[Phoenix] (So you say...)

[Phoenix] (But I wonder... Is that kind \ of control really possible?)

[White] I don't expect you to \ understand. It is a world \ beyond your compensation.

[White] ...

[White] You came here from \ Grodyburger's, I presume?

[Phoenix] Mr. Grossberg's... yes.

[White] Then you must ask him: \ Why is it that this painting \ of his hangs here?

[White] Perhaps then he will \ tell you?

[White] Perhaps he will explain \ how a man can live life \ purely for personal profit!

[White] ...

[White] Go now! Skedaddle! \ There is nothing more \ to discuss!

********************************************

***Talk/present after being asked to leave**

[White] Would you be kind enough to \ cease your inane chattering \ and vacate the premises?

[White] Let me put it in language \ you are sure to understand: \ Shut up and get out!

[Grossberg] Well, you see, it's just... \ Mia's sister, that poor girl.

***Talk about "Mr. White"*******************

[Phoenix] So, I paid Bluecorp a visit.

[Grossberg] Oh? Oh, I see.

[Phoenix] Mr. Grossberg...

[Phoenix] I have to admit, something \ has been bothering me.

[Grossberg] Oh? What is t? \ Well, out with it, my boy!

[Phoenix] You see, it's just...

***That big painting************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * Mr. Grossberg, sir...

[] * -Phoenix \ * There was a giant painting \ * hanging right there the \ * other day, was there not?

[] * -Phoenix \ * The one you said you had "no \ * intention of parting with"?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Well, I saw it. Today.

[] * -Phoenix \ * It was in the CEO's office \ * at Bluecorp. Redd White's \ * office.

[] * -Grossberg \ * ...

[] * -Grossberg \ * So... you noticed.

[] * -Grossberg \ * I suppose I should have \ * guessed you would. It is \ * a large painting...

[] * -Phoenix \ * Mr. Grossberg, I know \ * you and Mr. White are \ * connected somehow!

[] * -Grossberg \ * C-connected, you say?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Yes! And I know what \ * it is...

[] * ***He's giving you information************** \ * * \ * * -Phoenix \ * * You're his client, aren't you? \ * * He's giving you information! \ * * \ * * -Grossberg \ * * What's that now? \ * * \ * * -Phoenix \ * * You've been protecting \ * * him all along. \ * * \ * * -Phoenix \ * * You protect him because you \ * * need his services! \ * * \ * * -Grossberg \ * * ... \ * * \ * * -Phoenix \ * * You gave him that painting \ * * in exchange for some valuable \ * * information, didn't you? \ * * \ * * -Grossberg \ * * Utterly ridiculous. \ * * \ * * -Grossberg \ * * Me, his client? I would never \ * * willingly deal with that man. \ * * Never! \ * * \ * * -Phoenix \ * * (Huh? Did I get it wrong?) \ * * \ * * END \ * * \ * ********************************************

This may be the \ * * chance I've been waiting for. \ * * \ * * -Grossberg \ * * Maybe it's time to get this \ * * off my chest, so I can finally \ * * rest easy again. \ * * \ * * -Grossberg \ * * After all, you were Mia's \ * * understudy.

[] * ***You're lovers**************************** \ * * \ * * -Phoenix \ * * It's not something I can \ * * claim to understand... \ * * \ * * -Phoenix \ * * But you and Mr. White \ * * are lovers, aren't you! \ * * \ * * -Grossberg \ * * W-w-what! My boy! \ * * \ * * -Phoenix \ * * You sent that painting to him! \ * * \ * * -Phoenix \ * * As a sign! \ * * A sign of undying love! \ * * \ * * -Grossberg \ * * M-m-my boy, please! \ * * You're letting your fancies \ * * run away with you! \ * * \ * * -Grossberg \ * * Where do you get these \ * * bizarre ideas? \ * * \ * * -Phoenix \ * * I...

***That photo of Mr. White******************

[] * -Phoenix \ * That photo of Mr. White...

[] * -Phoenix \ * Why would you have his \ * photo, Mr. Grossberg?

[] * -Grossberg \ * Umm... yes, well. It's been \ * a long time since then...

[] * -Phoenix \ * A long time ago?

[] * -Phoenix \ * I'm sorry... but \ * I think not.

[] * -Phoenix \ * I think you still have \ * ties to Mr. White even today.

[] * -Grossberg \ * R-really! Whatever gave \ * you that idea!

[] * -Grossberg \ * W-what connection could I \ * possibly have to an individual \ * such as he?

[] * -Phoenix \ * It's pretty straightforward, \ * actually...

********************************************

[Grossberg] Redd White is a man who \ makes his living through \ intimidation.

[Grossberg] Bluecorp is a company that \ excels in finding people's \ weaknesses, I'm afraid.

[Grossberg] I've been paying them \ for 15 years now...

[Phoenix] (15 years...!)

[Grossberg] All because of the \ "DL-6 Incident," as you \ may have guessed.

[Phoenix] (The name on the back of \ those photographs!)

[Grossberg] As you suspected, I could \ not stand in defense of \ Maya because of this.

[Grossberg] White would have destroyed \ me if I did.

[Phoenix] (So that's the connection!)

[Grossberg] It is hard for me to tell \ you this, my boy.

[Grossberg] But arresting Redd White \ will be nigh on impossible.

[Phoenix] Impossible? Why!?

[Grossberg] He has information on \ everyone. It gives him \ an iron grip!

[Grossberg] He owns judges, attorneys, \ prosecutors, police... and \ politicians.

[Phoenix] What!?

[Grossberg] They are bound, unable \ to do harm to themselves, \ and therefore, to him.

[Grossberg] Don't look at me like that. \ What you see is nothing more \ than the weight of many years.

********************************************

***Talk about "The DL6 Incident"************

[Phoenix] What is the "DL-6 Incident"?

[Grossberg] "DL-6" is nothing more than \ the sorting code the police \ gave the case.

[Grossberg] It was 15 years ago now...

[Grossberg] I received a request from \ a medium. A spirit medium.

[Phoenix] (A medium...?)

[Grossberg] Her name was Misty Fey.

[Phoenix] (Fey!)

[Grossberg] Indeed. \ She was Mia's mother.

[Grossberg] She had been investigating \ a murder at the bequest of \ the police.

[Grossberg] And... she failed.

[Grossberg] As a result, the police \ called her a fraud.

[Phoenix] (This is what Maya was \ talking about the other day!)

[Grossberg] I did all I could for her, \ and in the end, cleared her \ of wrongdoing.

[Grossberg] That murder case, however \ remains unsolved to this day.

[Grossberg] That case, is the \ DL-6 Incident.

********************************************

***Talk about "Reason for blackmail"********

[Phoenix] But why were you blackmailed \ over this, Mr. Grossberg?

[Grossberg] The DL-6 Incident was top- \ secret at the time.

[Grossberg] It made sense. The police \ didn't want people to know \ they were using a medium!

[Grossberg] They couldn't let \ people know.

[Grossberg] But one person found out.

[Grossberg] I... I told him.

[Phoenix] You told White?

[Grossberg] He offered me riches... \ It is an embarrassment \ to me now.

[Grossberg] Because I talked, the police \ were mocked far and wide.

[Grossberg] In secret, they began looking \ for the one who sold them out.

[Grossberg] Of course White heard about \ it, and he came to me.

[Grossberg] Only this time, the offer \ was blackmail.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] I see.

[Grossberg] ...

[Grossberg] White controls the law of \ this country as he sees fit.

[Grossberg] Yet if you would still \ challenge him...

[Grossberg] Have a close look at \ Mia's office.

[Phoenix] Mia's office...?

[Grossberg] She followed his every \ move for years.

[Grossberg] She may have recorded \ something of what she found.

********************************************

[Phoenix] It's funny, looking at \ this room, it seems... \ so normal.

[Phoenix] Hard to imagine a murder took \ place here.

[Phoenix] Mr. Grossberg said there \ would be clues...

[Phoenix] Maybe I should have \ another look.

***Examine bookcase*************************

[Phoenix] All the cases the chief \ ever worked on are filed \ here.

[Phoenix] Which file should \ I look at...?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Let's see if there's \ * "A" record in this file \ * that catches my "I."

[] * -Phoenix \ * Hmmm... Should I take a look?

[] * ***Read it********************************** \ * * \ * * -Mia \ * * "'I have tarnished the Fey \ * * name.'

[Phoenix] (I need some evidence I can \ use as ammo...)

[White] What's wrong? Is something \ stuck to my face?

[White] Why yes! There's my eyes, \ and my nose, and my mouth...

[White] But of course I jest. \ You need not restrain \ your mirth, my friend!

[White] It is okay to indulge in my \ cosmopolitan sense of humor. \ I will not think less of you.

********************************************

***Present Newspaper Clipping***************

[Phoenix] (This is the only clue \ that Mia left me...)

[Phoenix] (I'd better make this \ one count!)

[Phoenix] Mr. White... see this?

[Phoenix] It's an article describing \ the suicide of a politician.

[White] ...

[Phoenix] He was embezzling secret \ government funds.

[Phoenix] Then, one day, word got \ leaked to the press.

[Phoenix] The very next day he took \ his own life.

[White] And this concerns me how...?

[Phoenix] I found this article \ in Mia's office.

[White] Miss Mia...?

[Phoenix] She had a file filled with \ articles like this.

[Phoenix] Every one of them was labeled \ with a single word... \ "White."

[White] ...!

[Phoenix] Mr. White, I know what \ you did to this politician.

***You bribed him***************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * You bribed him!

[] * -White \ * Hmph. You certainly have an \ * active imagination.

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Dammit!)

********************************************

***You spied on him*************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * You were spying on him, \ * weren't you?

[] * -White \ * "Spying"...?

[] * -Phoenix \ * You snooped on him, and found \ * out about the embezzlement.

[] * -Phoenix \ * Then, when you revealed \ * it, he was driven to suicide!

[] * -White \ * Mr. Lawyer.

[] * -White \ * I know nothing of this.

[] * -White \ * And, even in the highly \ * unlikely event that I did \ * do such a thing...

[] * -White \ * All I would have done is \ * provide "information." That is \ * not a crime in this country.

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Gah! This guy's as cool \ * as a cucumber...!)

********************************************

***You blackmailed him**********************

[] * -Phoenix \ * You were blackmailing him!

[] * -White \ * Blackmail?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Not just him, either. You were \ * threatening and coercing \ * hundreds of others!

[] * -Phoenix \ * This company is built \ * on blackmail!

[] * -Phoenix \ * I'm right, aren't I?

[] * -White \ * What a bizarre accusation.

[] * -White \ * Mr. Wrong...

[] * -White \ * What is it that you should be \ * doing now? Investigating me?

[] * -White \ * Hello. Chief Prosecutor?

[] * -White \ * I've changed my mind. \ * I want to testify tomorrow.

[] * -Interphone \ * [What's this about?]

[] * -White \ * The Mia Fey case. \ * I witnessed the murder, \ * you see.

[] * -White \ * And, thus, as a very \ * important witness, I would \ * like to testify.

[] * -Interphone \ * [What? Why now? \ * I thought you said you \ * didn't want to go to court?]

[] * -White \ * Quietude...! \ * I told  you I changed my \ * mind, didn't I?

[] * -White \ * Oh, and one other thing.

[] * -White \ * Send the police over \ * here right away.

[] * -White \ * The man is standing right \ * in front of me. He looks dazed \ * but could be violent!

[] * -Interphone \ * [What? What man?]

[] * -White \ * Are you even listening?

[] * -White \ * The executioner! The hatchet- \ * man! The liquidator... \ * The killer, man!

[] * -Phoenix \ * What!?

[] * -Interphone \ * [Mr. White... this isn't \ * another one of those...]

[] * -White \ * Chief Prosecutor.

[] * -White \ * I do not believe you are in \ * a position to freely offer \ * your opinions to me, correct?

[] * -White \ * I'm telling you to send \ * the police, now!

[] * -Interphone \ * *beep*

[] * -White \ * ...

[] * -White \ * Did I not tell you, \ * Mr. Wrong?

[] * -White \ * You are a mere lawyer!

[] * -White \ * As was Miss Mia.

[] * -Phoenix \ * How dare you!

[] * -White \ * I'll point the finger at you, \ * and you will be tried as \ * Miss Mia's killer!

[] * -White \ * The case is as good as \ * settled. No lawyer of any \ * worth will defend you.

[] * -White \ * I have friends in the local \ * lawyer's association, you see.

[] * -White \ * You'll be given a lawyer so \ * stupendously inept that they \ * make even you look competent.

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green September 8, 3:37 PM \ Detention Center \ Visitor's Room

[Phoenix] I can't believe it's only \ been a day since the first \ trial.

[Phoenix] My trial begins tomorrow.

[Phoenix] White's going to \ set a trap for me.

[Phoenix] And the prosecution will \ be in on it, of course. \ Edgeworth, included.

[Phoenix] An attorney was assigned to \ me by the state, yesterday.

[Phoenix] I refused. \ I had an idea.

[Maya] ...

[Maya] Wright!

[Maya] Mr. Wright!

[Phoenix] Oh, Maya!

[Phoenix] Great, they let you \ out of detention.

[Maya] Just now, yes. \ It's all thanks to you!

[Phoenix] Hah. Now I'm afraid we've \ switched places.

[Maya] What? You mean, you...?

[] ...

[Phoenix] I explained what had \ happened to Maya.

[Phoenix] ...

[] ...

[Maya] I don't believe it!

[Maya] How many people does that man \ need to destroy before he's \ satisfied!? My mother...

[Maya] My sister...

[Maya] And now you!

[Maya] This has gone too far!

[] Maya \ Mr. Wright, please tell me, \ is there anything I can do?

[Phoenix] Um... well...

***Defend me in court***********************

[Phoenix] Alright, you can be my \ defense lawyer tomorrow!

[Maya] Alright!

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Maya] Leave it to me! I am Mia's \ sister, after all! Lawyership \ runs in our blood!

[Phoenix] (Wasn't it E.S.P. that \ ran in your blood...?)

[Maya] I'd better run to the \ bookstore and pick up a copy \ of "Law for Rookies."

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Cheer me on in court*********************

[Phoenix] Well, you could cheer \ for me in court.

[Maya] Cheer for you? \ You mean... like a \ cheerleader?

[Phoenix] Huh? Um, yeah, like that.

[Maya] Alright! \ Leave it to me!

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Maya] I'd better go get a uniform \ and some pom-poms...!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Help me break out of here****************

[Phoenix] Right. Okay, listen up. \ I want you to help me break \ out of here!

[Maya] You mean... a jail break?

[Phoenix] Yeah. Tonight's our \ only chance!

[Maya] Alright!

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Maya] Oh, I'd better go get a \ hacksaw while the stores \ are still open.

[Maya] Oh, oh! And a rope ladder, \ and a getaway car! \ Can you drive?

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] W-wait. Wait wait wait.

[Maya] What what what?

[Phoenix] I'm kidding! It was a joke!

[Maya] No way!

[Phoenix] No really, I was kidding. \ But thanks. It's good to know \ you're on my side.

[Phoenix] (And there really isn't \ anything you can do \ for me anyway...)

[Maya] But... but I can't just sit \ here and do nothing!

[Maya] I've got to give that \ man a piece of my mind!

[Phoenix] (Just a piece...?)

[Phoenix] Okay.

[Phoenix] Then, come to the \ court tomorrow.

[Maya] O-okay! I'll be there!

[Maya] I'll show them \ a thing or two!

[] ...

[Phoenix] It's the beginning of a new \ century, yet with crime it's \ the same old story.

[Phoenix] In fact, it's gotten worse. \ Lengthy court proceedings \ are no longer realistic.

[Phoenix] Beginning a few years ago, \ a limit of three days was put \ on initial court trials.

[Phoenix] Almost all finish in a day. \ Most with a guilty verdict.

[Phoenix] I never thought I would \ end up in the defendant's \ chair myself.

[Phoenix] Tomorrow the true \ culprit will appear \ as a witness.

[Phoenix] This is it! \ It's me or him!

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green September 9, 9:52 AM \ District Court \ Defendant Lobby No. 1

[Maya] Well... I guess \ this is it!

[Phoenix] Yeah.

[Phoenix] One way or another, this \ case gets decided today.

[Maya] Aaa! \ Ph-Phoenix! Look!

[Phoenix] (...!)

[Phoenix] (Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)

[Edgeworth] I received a call from the \ public prosecutor's office \ yesterday.

[Phoenix] ?

[Edgeworth] He told me that whatever \ Mr. White says today, it will \ be the "absolute truth."

[Edgeworth] No matter how you try to \ attack his testimony...

[Edgeworth] If I raise an objection, \ I have it on good faith that \ the judge will listen to me.

[Phoenix] (What, does White have the \ judge in his pocket, too!?)

[Phoenix] So... you're saying I'm going \ to be guilty. End of story?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] I will do anything to get my \ verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.

[Maya] Why... \ Why!?

[Maya] How can you torment an \ innocent person like this!?

[Edgeworth] "Innocent"...?

[Edgeworth] How can we know that?

[Edgeworth] The guilty will always lie, \ to avoid being found out.

[Edgeworth] There's no way to tell \ who is guilty and who \ is innocent!

[Edgeworth] All that I can hope to do \ is get every defendant \ declared "guilty"!

[Edgeworth] So I make that my policy.

[Phoenix] Edgeworth...

[Phoenix] You've changed.

[Maya] Hmm?

[Maya] Phoenix! \ You know him!?

[Edgeworth] Don't expect any special \ treatment, Phoenix Wright.

[Maya] Ph-Phoenix...?

[Phoenix] Well... court will be opening \ for session soon.

[Maya] What? But wait!

[Maya] Your defense attorney isn't \ even here yet! He's not...

[Phoenix] I'll be defending myself.

[Maya] Whaaaat!?

[Phoenix] Okay, let's do this.

[] ...

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green September 9, 10:00 AM \ District Court \ Courtroom No. 1

[Judge] The court is now in \ session for the trial \ of Mr. Phoenix Wright.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution is ready, \ Your Honor.

[Phoenix] The defense is ready, \ Your Honor.

[Judge] Mr. Wright... \ Are you sure you're \ up to doing this?

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor. \ I will be defending myself.

[Judge] Understood.

[Judge] Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your \ opening statement, please.

[Edgeworth] As the details of the event \ are already quite clear to \ the court,

[Edgeworth] today we will hear the \ testimony of another witness \ to the defendant's crime.

[Judge] I see.

[Judge] The prosecution may call \ its witness.

[Phoenix] (That went far too smoothly!)

[Phoenix] (Why didn't the judge ask \ Edgeworth why his witness \ didn't testify before!?)

[Phoenix] (It's like... it's like \ he already knows why!)

[Phoenix] (Hmm. If anyone's going to \ raise an objection about \ this, I suppose it's me...)

***Objection********************************

[Phoenix] Mr. Edgeworth, you owe an \ explanation to the court!

[Phoenix] Why didn't this witness \ testify in the trial against \ Ms. Maya Fey!?

[Edgeworth] Hmph.

[Edgeworth] I'm ever so sorry!

[Edgeworth] Mr. White is a busy man, \ and besides...

[Edgeworth] at the time, I thought that \ Ms. May's opinion was all \ that would be needed.

[Edgeworth] Again, my sincerest \ apologies to the court.

[Judge] Excellent, Mr. Edgeworth. \ I appreciate your demeanor.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Phoenix] (Great. He gets to show \ off and I get nowhere.)

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Let it go********************************

[Phoenix] (Forget it. \ I smell a trap.)

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Edgeworth] I would like to call \ Mr. Redd White to the stand!

[] ...

[Edgeworth] Please state your full name.

[White] You wish to know the \ title of my personage?

[Edgeworth] Er... your name?

[White] Yes! That is what I said!

[White] Oh dear, do my \ locutions confuse?

[Edgeworth] Name!

[Phoenix] (These two are great \ together...)

[White] My name is Redd White. \ But my friends call me \ Blanco Nino.

[White] I am the CEO, or to use a more \ common term, the President, \ of Bluecorp.

[Edgeworth] Did you know the victim, \ Ms. Mia Fey?

[White] That would be a negatory! \ No, I did not.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] You were at the Gatewater \ Hotel the night of the \ murder?

[White] Correct.

[Edgeworth] And you witnessed the \ murder from there?

[White] Ahem. Why tell you what \ you already know?

[Judge] Very well, Mr. White. You \ may begin your testimony.

[Phoenix] (If I can't rip this guy's \ testimony apart, I'm \ done for.)

[Phoenix] (Why do I always feel like \ it's the end of the world and \ I'm the last man standing?)

[White] Ho hoh hoh.

[White] I hope you have made your \ peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!

[Phoenix] ...!

[Maya] Let him have it, Phoenix!

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Witness's Account --

[White] (1) \ Let's see, it was about \ 9:00, I believe.

[White] (2) \ I was quietly perusifying... \ er, that's "reading" to you, \ some papers by the window.

[White] (3) \ Then I heard a bedlam \ coming from outside!

[White] (4) \ Surprised, I turned to \ look at the building \ across the way.

[White] (5) \ It was then I saw him: \ a spiky-haired man attacking \ a woman with long hair!

[White] (6) \ Needless to say that man was \ none other than you, \ Mr. Lawyer!

[White] (7) \ I called Miss May over \ at once. She, too, was \ flabbergasted of course.

[White] (8) \ The victim, she... she ran \ away, but you gave chase!

[White] (9) \ Finally there was a \ terrible impaction! \ Then it was all over...

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] If things occurred as you \ testify, then I'm afraid the \ defendant is guilty.

[Judge] Very well, defendant... er, \ I mean, Mr. Wright.

[Judge] Your cross-examination...

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Witness's Account --

[White] (1) \ Let's see, it was about \ 9:00, I believe.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] How do you know what time \ it was?

[White] Because I am always \ abso-posi-lutely perfect, \ you know?

[Phoenix] No no no, you're not getting \ away with that!

[White] You are so mistrusting, \ Mr. Lawyer!

[White] So... what was the proper \ term for "secretary" again...?

[White] Anyway, Miss May ordered \ room service for 9:00.

[White] It happened soon after the \ room service arrived.

[Phoenix] (Hmm. That's what Miss May \ said, too.)

***Press further****************************

[Phoenix] True, the bellboy who brought \ the coffee saw Miss May.

[Phoenix] But he testified that he \ did not see you at the time!

[White] Ahem. This is your concern?

[White] Silly Lawyer! Miss May \ received the coffee outside \ the room!

[White] Of course he could not see me. \ He would need X-ray vision to \ pull off something like that!

[Phoenix] (Hmm...)

[Edgeworth] Tell us, what were you \ doing at the time?

********************************************

***Hold back********************************

[Phoenix] (I don't see anything to gain \ by attacking him on this \ point any further.)

[Phoenix] Okay, what were you \ doing at the time?

********************************************

[White] (2) \ I was quietly perusifying... \ er, that's "reading" to you, \ some papers by the window.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] By window, you mean the one \ directly across from the \ Fey & Co. Law Office?

[White] Correct! That is the only \ window, you see.

[Phoenix] And there you were \ reading... papers?

[White] Correct!

[White] The Gatewater is a business- \ man's hotel, and I am a busy \ man who had business to do!

[White] (3) \ Then I heard a bedlam \ coming from outside!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] A "bedlam"?

[White] It must have been when \ you attacked, I assume.

[Edgeworth] We see. Continue.

[White] (4) \ Surprised, I turned to \ look at the building \ across the way.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So you were reading your \ papers until you heard \ that sound?

[White] But of course. I am \ no snoop, peeping out of \ windows at night.

[Phoenix] (No snoop? Yeah, right! \ You've made a career \ out of snooping!)

[White] (5) \ It was then I saw him: \ a spiky-haired man attacking \ a woman with long hair!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] S-spiky-haired!?

[White] (6) \ Needless to say that man was \ none other than you, \ Mr. Lawyer!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What you just said directly \ conflicts with Miss May's \ testimony!

[Phoenix] Miss May clearly stated that \ the assailant looked like \ a "girl"!

[White] I've always been proud \ of my eyesight, Mr. Lawyer.

[Phoenix] Just what is your eyesight?

[White] Counting both eyes... 40!

[Phoenix] 40!? Don't add them together!

[Judge] I think the witness is trying \ to say his eyesight is good.

[Phoenix] (Hey, whose side is the \ judge on, anyway?)

[Edgeworth] And what did you do then?

[White] (7) \ I called Miss May over \ at once. She, too, was \ flabbergasted of course.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What was Miss May doing \ at that time?

[White] She had just finished \ watching a soap opera on the \ TV, and was weeping openly.

[Phoenix] Did you know she had been \ tapping the Fey office phone?

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Irrelevant! That has nothing \ to do with the case at hand.

[White] I care not. I will answer the \ lawyer's bold inquiry.

[White] Miss May was acting alone \ when she tapped the phone \ of this Fey woman.

[Phoenix] You'd make a good politician, \ Mr. White.

[White] Ho hoh! After all, I am \ "El Presidente."

[Judge] Please continue.

[White] (8) \ The victim, she... she ran \ away, but you gave chase!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Can you be a little more \ detailed about that?

[Phoenix] I think it's worth knowing \ exactly what happened.

[White] Of course! Comprende! \ I understand!

[White] The victim was attacked, \ by you, and ran to the left.

[White] You gave chase, and struck \ her down!

[Edgeworth] Are you sure?

[White] As you know, I am always \ abso-posi-lutely perfect!

[Judge] Perhaps you could change \ your testimony to reflect \ this new detail.

[] CHANGE TO 8b

[White] (8b) \ The victim ran to the left, \ and you gave chase!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Are you sure about that?

[White] How many times must I say it?

[White] I am abso-posi-lutely perfect! \ End of story!

[Phoenix] (How many times must \ I hear that?)

[Maya] Psst! Phoenix!

[Maya] Doesn't something about \ that strike you as a \ little odd?

[White] (9) \ Finally there was a \ terrible impaction! \ Then it was all over...

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Um... "impaction"? \ Don't you mean just "impact"?

[White] Ridiculosity! I think you need \ to brush up on your language \ skills!

[Phoenix] (On second thought, perhaps \ I'd better leave the whole \ language thing alone...)

[Phoenix] (Did Edgeworth "prep" this guy, \ too, I wonder?)

[Phoenix] (Anyway, I'd better find \ a weakness in there...)

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Wait right there!

[Phoenix] Mr. White, you've \ dug your own grave!

[White] What is this!?

[Phoenix] You said the victim ran \ to the "left."

[Phoenix] But that directly contradicts \ Miss May's testimony!

[Phoenix] She clearly stated that the \ victim ran "right"!

[White] ...!

[White] Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. \ You have misheard her.

[Phoenix] I think not.

[Phoenix] Look at the floor plans...

[Phoenix] The killer was here.

[Phoenix] And the victim, here.

[Phoenix] If the victim ran to the \ left, as you claim she did...

[Phoenix] She would have been running \ directly away from the door!

[Phoenix] She would have been running \ into a dead end!

[Phoenix] Don't you find that odd?

[White] !

[White] Very strange...

[White] I did see her run to the \ left... I did.

[Maya] Phoenix... look at his face. \ I don't think he's lying \ about this one.

[Phoenix] True.

[Phoenix] (Maybe he really did see \ the victim run left...?)

[Phoenix] (So he did witness the \ killing...?)

[Phoenix] (Wait a second!)

[Judge] Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor?

[Judge] Miss May says "right," and \ Mr. White says "left."

[Judge] Can you explain this \ contradiction to the court?

***Mr. White is right***********************

[Phoenix] As Mr. White testified, \ Mia ran to the left.

[Judge] But... \ But if that's the case...

[Judge] Why would she run in the \ opposite direction from \ the door?

[Phoenix] She did not. She was running \ towards the door, Your Honor.

[Edgeworth] Bwah! \ Now you're the one making \ a contradiction, Mr. Wright!

[Phoenix] Not at all.

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Miss May is right************************

[Phoenix] As Miss May has stated, Mia \ ran to the right after she \ was attacked.

[White] What is this? \ I am not fashioning \ fabrications, I assure you!

[White] That lady ran to the left! \ I am sure of it!

[Phoenix] Then there can be \ only one explanation.

[Edgeworth] Eh...? And that is?

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Both are right***************************

[Phoenix] Both witnesses are \ telling the truth. \ (For once...)

[Edgeworth] Hah! I doubt it!

[Edgeworth] Er, rather, that does not \ clear up the contradiction!

[Phoenix] There is one scenario that \ would explain their \ conflicting accounts.

[Edgeworth] What!?

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] Obviously, the witness was not \ viewing the crime from the \ hotel!

[Judge] Mr. Wright! What do you mean?

[Edgeworth] Yes, what do you mean, \ he was not "viewing the crime \ from the hotel"!?

[Edgeworth] If he was not in the hotel, \ where could he have been!?

[Phoenix] In the law offices of \ Fey & Co., of course!

[Phoenix] More specifically, he \ was standing here!

[Phoenix] (Show the court where \ Mr. White was standing!)

***Present location of victim***************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] That's where he was!

[Edgeworth] M-Mr. Wright! \ We are not fools!

[Edgeworth] How could he have been \ exactly where the victim \ was standing!?

[Phoenix] (Oh... oh, right!)

[Judge] Mr. Wright! \ What is the meaning of this!?

[Phoenix] Sorry, Your Honor! Sorry! \ Let me try that again...

[] RETURN TO FLOOR PLANS

********************************************

***Present anywhere*************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] That's where he was!

[Judge] Hold it right there, \ Mr. Wright!

[Judge] If he was there during \ the very act of murder...

[Judge] That would make him \ an accomplice!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Impossible!

[Edgeworth] There was no one other than \ the criminal and victim in \ the room!

[Edgeworth] There is no evidence, no \ proof to the contrary! None!

[Phoenix] S-sorry! Er... let me \ try that again!

[] RETURN TO FLOOR PLANS

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] This is where he was!

[Phoenix] Look!

[Phoenix] When the victim ran for \ the door...

[Phoenix] If he was watching from this \ point, to him it would appear \ that she ran to the "left."

[Edgeworth] Please! This is no time for \ jokes in ill taste!

[Edgeworth] That is where the \ killer was standing!

[Judge] Order! I will have order!

[Judge] Anyone disturbing the order \ of this courtroom will be \ held in contempt!

[Judge] Mr. Wright! \ What are you suggesting!?

[White] R-r-rapscallion!!!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] The postulations of the \ defense are a distortion \ of the truth, Your Honor!

[Judge] Indeed. \ They do seem a bit \ far-fetched...

[White] ...

[White] Ho hoh hoh!

[White] You provide us with so \ much entertainment, \ Mr. Lawyer!

[Phoenix] (What now!? \ He's... laughing!?)

[White] The hilarity of the moment \ made me remember something...

[White] It appears I have been \ unclear, and for this, \ I apologize.

[White] Mr. Your Honor...

[White] Might I be allowed to \ testify once more?

[Judge] Very well, let's hear \ your revised testimony.

[Phoenix] (Good luck. You can't fix \ a broken testimony, buddy!)

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- She Ran to the "Left" --

[White] (1) \ Miss May's testimony was \ correct... as was mine!

[White] (2) \ When you assaulted the girl, \ she first ran to the left.

[White] (3) \ And then you hit her, \ savagely! That is what I saw.

[White] (4) \ Next, with the last \ of her strength, she \ ran to the right.

[White] (5) \ You chased her, and delivered \ the final blow.

[White] (6) \ That is what Miss May saw.

[White] (7) \ You see? \ You hit her twice!

[White] Don't you remember, \ Mr. Lawyer?

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm... \ That does seem to make sense.

[Judge] Will you be cross-examining \ the witness's testimony?

[Phoenix] You bet I will! \ I mean, yes, Your Honor.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- She Ran to the "Left" --

[White] (1) \ Miss May's testimony was \ correct... as was mine!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What do you mean by that!

[White] That is what I am \ about to explain!

[White] You Americans, always so \ impatient! It does not \ become you.

[Phoenix] (Hey buddy, you're an \ American, too!)

[White] (2) \ When you assaulted the girl, \ she first ran to the left.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What do you mean "first"?

[White] "First"? That is what comes \ before what happens "next." \ You do speak English, right?

[White] Please, sit back, relax. \ I will try to use simple \ words for your benefit.

[White] First, she ran to the left, \ and then...

[White] (3) \ And then you hit her, \ savagely! That is what I saw.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] I didn't hit anyone!

[White] Now, now, Mr. Wright. \ There is no point hiding \ things from this court.

[Phoenix] I'm not hiding anything!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] The prosecution requests that \ the defense refrain from \ interrupting the testimony!

[Judge] Mr. Wright, you have \ been warned.

[Phoenix] (Why's he mad at me!?)

[White] (4) \ Next, with the last \ of her strength, she \ ran to the right.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What do you mean "next"!?

[White] "Next" is what comes \ after "first."

[Phoenix] I know that!

[White] Then that is all you need \ to know, Mr. Lawyer.

[White] As I said, she turned and \ made a desperate dash to \ the right.

[White] (5) \ You chased her, and delivered \ the final blow.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Stop saying it was me!

[White] But, it was you.

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Mr. Wright! If you claim \ that it was NOT you, then \ show us proof!

[Phoenix] (Argh! Can I do nothing \ right? Nothing!?)

[White] May I continue?

[White] (6) \ That is what Miss May saw.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So each of you saw \ different parts...?

[White] Abso-posi-lutely! \ That's right, of course!

[Phoenix] (Where did he pick up \ that annoying phrase...?)

[White] Anyway, moving along!

[White] (7) \ You see? \ You hit her twice!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So were you watching \ both times?

[White] I suppose I was.

[White] And please excuse me for not \ testifying to this sooner!

[Maya] What do you think Phoenix?

[Phoenix] I think we've got him \ right where we want him! \ He slipped!

[Phoenix] Let him laugh for now. \ I'll soon wipe that smile \ off his face!

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Mr. White!

[Phoenix] The victim died from \ a "single" blow!

[White] ...!

[Phoenix] What do you have \ to say to that?

[White] Er... Erp!

[Phoenix] (Now's my chance to \ hit him where it counts!)

[Phoenix] Mr. White. Wasn't it you who \ told this court you were \ "abso-posi-lutely perfect"?

[White] Mmph.

[White] I will refrain from using \ this phrase from now on.

[Phoenix] Your Honor, if you could ask \ the witness for a new \ testimony...

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] The witness is obviously \ confused, Your Honor!

[Edgeworth] I would like to request \ a 10 minute break!

[Judge] Yes... yes, quite.

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] The witness is confused \ because he's lying!

[Phoenix] I emphatically request that \ there be no break, Your Honor!

[] (Yeah! We want justice...!)

[] (Don't let him get away!)

[Judge] Very well.

[Judge] If the witness would care to \ revise his testimony...

[Phoenix] (The crowd's on my side! \ No slipping out of this \ now, White!)

[Judge] Mr. White?

[White] O... okay...

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- The Two Accounts --

[White] (1) \ Umm, well, see--I looked at \ the other window when I heard \ that thing fall.

[White] (2) \ Then, the next moment, I saw \ Miss Mia run to the left!

[White] (3) \ The killer, you, attacked \ her... but she dodged.

[White] Umm... and then...

[White] (4) \ She turned, and ran \ for the door!

[White] (5) \ Then you did her in with \ a single blow! Thwap!

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm. "Thwap" indeed.

[Judge] Very well, you may begin \ the cross-examination.

[White] Mr. Your Honor...

[White] My stomach, you see, \ it is hurting...

[Phoenix] Deal with it.

[Phoenix] This is almost over.

[White] ...!

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- The Two Accounts --

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] You heard "that thing fall"? \ What exactly was "that thing"?

[White] Huh? Oh... oh, that? \ Umm... the glass light stand!

[Phoenix] (Right... the one that had \ fallen over at the scene.)

[Maya] Phoenix!

[Maya] Doesn't something about \ that strike you as odd?

***Yeah, very odd***************************

[Phoenix] (Yeah, that is odd. \ I'll press further.)

[Phoenix] Mr. White

[White] Huh? W-what?

[Phoenix] You're saying you saw \ the glass light stand?

[White] Y-yes.

[Phoenix] Then change your testimony \ to reflect that!

[White] S-sorry. \ My bad...

[Judge] The witness will revise \ his testimony.

[White] Okay okay. Of course.

[] CHANGE TO 1b

********************************************

***Nope*************************************

[Phoenix] Huh? \ No, not really.

[Judge] Please continue your \ cross-examination.

********************************************

[White] (1b) \ A light stand was lying on \ the floor when I looked.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] The "glass stand was lying \ on the floor"? That's the \ first I've heard of this.

[Phoenix] Why didn't you tell us \ about the stand before?

[White] W-why? Me?

[White] W-well... I was instructed \ not to... wait!

[White] One moment! \ Give me a minute to gather \ my thoughts.

[White] I am so... so confused.

[Phoenix] (White's falling apart.)

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Your Honor! Please, I ask that \ you do not allow the witness \ to be badgered any further!

[Judge] M-Mr. Wright.

[Judge] Please refrain from badgering \ the witness...

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor. \ (Edgeworth is on the ropes!)

[Judge] Very well. The witness \ may continue his account.

[White] (2) \ Then, the next moment, I saw \ Miss Mia run to the left!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "Miss Mia"...?

[Phoenix] Mr. White, did you know \ the victim personally?

[White] No no no, triple no! \ How would I? How could I!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] I see nothing odd about \ the witness knowing \ the name of the victim.

[Edgeworth] Mr. Wright! I will not have \ you harrying the witness!

[Phoenix] (You're looking a little \ flustered, Edgeworth!)

[White] (3) \ The killer, you, attacked \ her... but she dodged.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Now before, you said that she \ was hit before she ran.

[White] Y-yes, I must have \ been confused.

[White] But don't worry! \ We all know what happened now.

[White] (4) \ She turned, and ran \ for the door!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What did you do then?

[White] I gave chase, of course!

[White] ...!

[White] No! No! Not me. \ Th-the killer, I mean! \ He gave chase!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Mr. White, please try \ to remain calm.

[Edgeworth] Mr. Wright here is only trying \ to fluster you with baseless \ accusations!

[White] Oh... oh right. Thank you, \ Miles.

[White] (5) \ Then you did her in with \ a single blow! Thwap!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "Thwap"...?

[Phoenix] That doesn't sound like the \ "savage" attack from your \ earlier testimony...

[White] Ho! Hoh hoh! Yes, well, \ I am a man of peace, you see.

[Maya] Phoenix!

[Maya] He's getting a lot \ less talkative.

[Phoenix] He's probably afraid I'll \ catch him on something!

[Phoenix] (But it won't be easy!)

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Mr. White.

***If Glass Shards presented****************

[Phoenix] It was impossible for you \ to have seen the light stand!

[White] Whaaaat!?

[Phoenix] The stand broke into \ pieces when it fell!

[White] Ooof!

[Phoenix] Just by seeing the broken \ pieces you would have no \ idea it was a light stand!

[Phoenix] So tell me, exactly when \ was it that you saw the stand?

[Phoenix] Answer the question!

[White] ...!

[White] I-isn't it obvious? \ I saw the stand before it \ fell over!

[Phoenix] So... you saw the stand \ before the victim was \ attacked, then?

[White] C-correct! That would be \ no problemo, right?

[Phoenix] (Hmm...)

***No problemo******************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * Right. \ * I guess there isn't a problem.

[] * -Judge \ * Very well. \ * Now...

[] * -Maya \ * Ph-Phoenix! \ * Wait!

[] * -Phoenix \ * Huh? What?

[] * -Maya \ * He saw the stand through the \ * office window before it fell \ * over...

[] * -Maya \ * That's what he's saying, \ * right?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Yeah, I guess so.

[] * -Maya \ * How could that be possible?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Huh...? Why not?

[] * -Maya \ * There's no way he could have \ * seen it! And you have proof!

[] * -Phoenix \ * ...

[] * -Phoenix \ * Oh!

[] * -Judge \ * Something wrong, Mr. Wright?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Sorry, Your Honor! \ * I guess there is a problemo, \ * er, I mean, a problem.

[] * -Judge \ * I see. Please try to think \ * before you speak, Mr. Wright.

[] * -Phoenix \ * Sorry, Your Honor.

[] * -Phoenix \ * But, I have proof!

[] * CONTINUE

********************************************

***Big problemo*****************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * There's a big problemo, er, \ * I mean problem here.

[] * -White \ * What problem is this?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Mr. White, let me make sure \ * I have this straight...

[] * -Phoenix \ * You saw the glass light \ * stand through the window, \ * from the hotel...

[] * -Phoenix \ * before the incident occurred?

[] * -White \ * Correct! That is so! \ * It's conclusive, definitive, \ * undeniable... unimpeachable!

[] * -Phoenix \ * No, it's impossible! \ * You couldn't have seen \ * the stand!

[] * -Judge \ * What? Why couldn't he? \ * You have proof?

[] * -Phoenix \ * I sure do, Your Honor!

[] * CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] A person in the hotel could \ not have seen the stand before \ it fell over!

***Present something wrong******************

[] * -Phoenix \ * *TAKE THAT!*

[] * -Phoenix \ * This is the proof!

[] * -Phoenix \ * ...

[] * -Judge \ * Something the matter?

[] * -Phoenix \ * N-no... it's just...

[] * -Maya \ * Phoenix... I don't think \ * that's what you meant.

[] * -Phoenix \ * (I don't think so either.)

[] * -Judge \ * Mr. Wright. The courtroom \ * is no place to play \ * practical jokes.

***If Floor Plans presented*****************

[Phoenix] It was impossible for you \ to have seen the glass stand!

[White] Whaaaat!?

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] Look at this!

[Judge] These are the floor plans to \ the scene of the murder, yes?

[Phoenix] Correct, Your Honor. \ Now, look...

[Phoenix] If you were to look through \ the window at the office...

[Phoenix] This is the area you \ would be able to see!

[] Phoenix \ Here!

[Phoenix] Well...?

[Phoenix] Note that the stand is not \ within the visible area!

[Phoenix] Well, Mr. White!

[Phoenix] What do you have to \ say to that!?

[White] Er... erp!

[White] Ri... dicu... losity...

[Phoenix] Mr. White.

[Phoenix] If you were in the Gatewater \ hotel as you claim,

[Phoenix] you could not have seen the \ stand before it fell over!

[Phoenix] In fact, you wouldn't have \ been able to see it after \ it fell, either!

[Phoenix] There's no way you could have \ recognized the broken shards \ as a glass light stand!

[Phoenix] So, when did you see \ the stand, Mr. White?

[Phoenix] It must have been the \ moment that it fell!

[Phoenix] And the only place you could \ have seen that from... is \ inside the Fey Law Offices!

[Phoenix] In other words, you were \ at the scene of the crime, \ when the murder took place!

[White] Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!

[] ...

[Judge] Mr... White?

[White] ...

[Phoenix] Mr. White.

[White] ...

[Phoenix] You did it, didn't you?

[White] ...

[White] Mr. Your Honor.

[White] I... I... \ Miss Mia...

[White] ...

[Phoenix] (Heh. Looks like we're about \ to get our verdict!)

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] That's far enough, \ Phoenix Wright!

[Phoenix] W-what!? \ (Urk! I forgot about \ Edgeworth!)

[Edgeworth] Mr. White...

[White] ...

[Edgeworth] I think the time has come.

[Edgeworth] Shouldn't you confess \ your crime now, hmm?

[White] W... what?

[Edgeworth] I said, you should confess \ your crime.

[Edgeworth] Ergo,

[Edgeworth] confess that you placed \ the wiretap!

[Phoenix] The w-wiretap!?

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth! Explain to the \ court what you mean by this!

[Edgeworth] Distinguished members of \ of the court...

[Edgeworth] Mr. White is slightly \ confused.

[Edgeworth] Allow me to explain.

[Phoenix] (I really don't like the \ way this is headed...)

[Edgeworth] As you know, Mr. White is \ the CEO of Bluecorp.

[Edgeworth] He ordered his secretary, \ Miss April May, to tap the \ law offices of Ms. Fey.

[Judge] What does that have to do...?

[Edgeworth] Your Honor.

[Edgeworth] The question is: when was the \ wiretap placed in the office, \ and by who?

[Phoenix] No! You wouldn't!

[Edgeworth] Mr. White.

[Edgeworth] In order to place the \ wiretap, you entered \ Ms. Fey's office.

[Edgeworth] Am I correct...?

[White] ...

[White] !

[White] C-correct! You are \ most correct, Miles!

[Phoenix] Give me a break!

[White] Yes... in order to place the \ wiretap, I breached the \ Fey & Co. Law Offices!

[White] That is when I saw that \ accursed light stand!

[Judge] Now I'm confused. Please \ explain to the court what \ all this means, Mr. Edgeworth!

[Edgeworth] Gladly, Your Honor.

[Edgeworth] Mr. Phoenix Wright has made \ his position quite clear.

[Edgeworth] He has determined that \ Mr. White knew the glass \ stand was in the office.

[Edgeworth] He has shown that there was \ only one time Mr. White \ could have seen the stand:

[Edgeworth] At the very moment of \ the murder!

[Edgeworth] Thus, Mr. Wright would like \ you to believe that Mr. White \ was the murderer!

[Judge] I see.

[Edgeworth] However!

[Edgeworth] It is a fact that Mr. White \ had been to that office well \ before the murder took place!

[Edgeworth] He went to place the wiretap!

[Edgeworth] He could have seen the \ glass light stand then.

[Edgeworth] Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's \ theory is revealed for the \ baseless conjecture it is!

[Judge] Mr. White!

[Judge] You will testify to the \ court about this wiretap!

[White] Ahem. \ Leave it to me!

[Phoenix] (I... I feel faint.)

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- The Wiretapping --

[White] (1) \ It was the beginning of \ September... the week \ before the murder.

[White] (2) \ I had entered the \ Fey & Co. Law Offices.

[White] (3) \ Of course, I had done so \ to place the wiretap.

[White] (4) \ That is when I saw this \ glass light stand.

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] So, you saw the stand \ before the night of \ the incident...

[Judge] And this is how you were able \ to identify what had fallen \ over. By the sound?

[White] Correct! \ That is right.

[Judge] I see. \ Very well, Mr. Wright, you \ may cross-examine.

[Phoenix] (Gah! What am I supposed \ to do now...!?)

[Maya] Good luck, Phoenix...

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- The Wiretapping --

[White] (1) \ It was the beginning of \ September... the week \ before the murder.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] D-do you have proof!?

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Miss April May knew the \ details of Ms. Fey's \ phone conversation!

[Edgeworth] This proves that the wiretap \ was placed before the murder!

[Phoenix] Huh... right.

[White] (2) \ I had entered the \ Fey & Co. Law Offices.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Was it really you that \ went into the office?

[Phoenix] Or was it Miss May?

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Unidentified fingerprints \ several days old were found \ in the Fey & Co. Law Offices.

[Edgeworth] Those were obviously \ Mr. White's.

[Phoenix] (And if I know Edgeworth, he's \ already run a check on those \ prints...)

[Edgeworth] Now, Mr. White. Tell us why \ you went to the Fey & Co. \ Law Offices.

[White] (3) \ Of course, I had done so \ to place the wiretap.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Why did you tap Mia's \ phone!?

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] That has no bearing on \ the current case, Your Honor.

[White] Bluecorp is a detective \ agency of sorts.

[White] We have a responsibility to \ protect client \ confidentiality!

[White] (4) \ That is when I saw this \ glass light stand.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Why did you notice something \ as innocuous as a light \ stand!?

[White] The light stand was made \ entirely out of glass.

[White] It was quite stylish, so \ I guess it made a lasting \ impression on me.

[White] Such a beautacious thing \ deserves attention, \ does it not?

[White] That is all.

[Phoenix] (Dammit! There's nothing \ there for me to press him on!)

[Phoenix] (Oh well... maybe he's rattled \ enough that I can bluff \ something out of him!)

[] CONTINUE AFTER PRESSING FOR A SHORT WHILE

[] ...

[Phoenix] (Uh oh! Don't tell me \ I've run out of ammo!)

[Edgeworth] Tsk tsk. \ I'm afraid that's as \ far as you go, Mr. Wright.

[Edgeworth] The time has come for you \ to admit your defeat!

[Edgeworth] You fought... honorably.

[Phoenix] (No more...)

[Phoenix] (I can't take this anymore...)

[Judge] Mr. Wright?

[Judge] Are you giving up?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Y-yes, Your Honor.

[???] (Phoenix!)

[Phoenix] ...?

[???] (Phoenix! Over here!)

[Phoenix] (I know that voice!)

[Phoenix] (...)

[Phoenix] (M-Mia!?)

[Mia] Never give up, Phoenix!

[Phoenix] ...!!!!

[Phoenix] M-M-Mia...!

[] ...

[Phoenix] Where... \ Where am I?

[Phoenix] The waiting lobby...?

[Phoenix] What happened?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Oh, right...

[Phoenix] I lost the trial.

[Phoenix] I was... hallucinating.

[Phoenix] ...

[Mia] Ah, you're finally awake.

[Phoenix] Gak!

[] ...

[Mia] H-hey! \ Phoenix!

[Mia] ...

[Mia] "Gak"? That's no way \ to greet an old friend!

[Mia] Phoenix, I want you \ to look at me.

[Phoenix] Y-You're...

[Phoenix] M-Maya...?

[Mia] Didn't you know the Fey \ women have strong psychic \ powers...?

[Mia] When you accepted your \ defeat in court...

[Mia] It appears that was enough \ of a shock to awaken \ Maya's true powers.

[Phoenix] So... Maya is channeling \ you, Mia?

[Mia] That's right. I am Maya, \ but I'm also Mia.

[Mia] Now, I want you to listen \ to me, Phoenix.

[Mia] Maya never gave up. \ You can't either!

[Mia] That's what I came here \ to tell you.

[Phoenix] ...!

[Phoenix] B-but!

[Mia] We don't have much time, \ Phoenix. Now listen.

[Mia] You've already won.

[Phoenix] Huh...?

[Mia] You have that Receipt in \ the court record, right?

[Phoenix] Um... oh, yeah! The one you \ wrote "Maya" on...?

[Mia] Phoenix! White wrote that, \ not me!

[Phoenix] So... so what do I do with it?

[Mia] Look at the front of \ the receipt!

[Phoenix] The... front?

[Phoenix] (It's a regular receipt...)

[Phoenix] (Looks like it's from a \ famous department store.)

[Phoenix] ("$1,000.00"... wow, big \ spender!)

[Phoenix] ("Item"... \ "glass light stand"...!)

[Phoenix] ("Date of purchase"... \ "September 4"...)

[Phoenix] ...!

[Phoenix] September 4!

[Mia] That's right, Phoenix.

[Mia] I bought that stand the \ day before I was killed!

[Phoenix] Whoa!

[Mia] Now, what did Mr. White \ say in his testimony?

[White] It was the beginning of \ September... the week \ before the murder.

[Phoenix] He said he saw the stand \ the week before the murder!

[Mia] There you go!

[Mia] I think the court is \ about to reconvene!

[Mia] Go do it, Phoenix! \ You know you're innocent, \ now you just have to prove it!

[Phoenix] Right!

[Judge] Is the defendant... rather, \ are you alright, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Yes. \ Sorry, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] I'm fine now.

[Judge] Then, let's start where \ we left off.

[Edgeworth] Your Honor.

[Edgeworth] There is nothing to \ go back to!

[Edgeworth] The cross-examination of \ Mr. White is finished!

[Edgeworth] All that is required now is \ for you to pass judgment on \ the defendant Phoenix Wright!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] Please, give me \ one more chance.

[Phoenix] I promise you, this is the \ last time I'll ask you!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] But, as Mr. Edgeworth has \ noted, the trial is more or \ less finished.

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth, do you have an \ opinion on this matter?

[Edgeworth] I say... let us give \ Mr. Phoenix Wright his \ "last chance."

[Judge] Very well!

[Judge] You may begin your \ cross-examination.

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- The Wiretapping --

[White] (1) \ It was the beginning of \ September... the week \ before the murder.

[Edgeworth] Miss April May knew the \ details of Ms. Fey's \ phone conversation!

[Phoenix] Huh... right.

[Judge] Objection sustained. \ Mr. Wright...

[Judge] I don't see how asking the \ same questions again will \ make any difference.

[Phoenix] (Right! I have to show him the \ evidence Mia gave me!)

[White] (4) \ That is when I saw this \ glass light stand.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Why did you notice something \ as innocuous as a light \ stand!?

[White] The light stand was made \ entirely out of glass.

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Look closely at this.

[Phoenix] See the word "Maya" written \ in blood...?

[Edgeworth] Bwah hah! \ You're grasping!

[Phoenix] I think not. Look at the \ other side of the receipt.

[Edgeworth] Th-the other side?

[Phoenix] Your Honor.

[Phoenix] Would you tell the court \ what is written on the other \ side of that receipt?

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Well!

[Judge] A "glass light stand"!

[Judge] And the date of purchase...

[Judge] Why, that's the day \ before the murder!

[Phoenix] You see!

[Phoenix] Mr. White.

[Phoenix] When you allegedly entered \ Fey & Co. Law Offices at the \ beginning of September...

[Phoenix] The stand could not \ have been there!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Well, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] I understand there must be \ quite a bit of PRESSURE \ on you.

[Phoenix] But I think you'll agree you \ can't judge me "guilty" under \ these circumstances.

[Edgeworth] Not so fast, Phoenix Wright!

[Phoenix] Eh?

[Phoenix] (What! No way he can worm \ his way out of this one!)

[Phoenix] (Oh wait... I forgot. \ It's Edgeworth.)

[Edgeworth] There is a certain thread \ of logic to the defendant's \ claims.

[Edgeworth] However!

[Edgeworth] There is no concrete proof \ that Phoenix Wright is \ innocent!

[Phoenix] (...!)

[Edgeworth] Ergo!

[Edgeworth] I would like to request one \ more day before Phoenix Wright \ is granted his freedom.

[Maya] Wait, no, on second thought, \ let's make this casual!

[Maya] Yo, Nick! Maya here, ready \ to get down to business!

[Maya] You... don't mind me calling \ you "Nick," do you?

[Maya] It's a great name! Mia said \ that's what your friend \ Larry calls you.

[Phoenix] ("Nick"...?)

[Maya] You know what this means? \ We're partners!

[] ...

[Phoenix] You know, when I think \ about it...

[Phoenix] It is Maya's fault \ I'm here now.

[Phoenix] But...

[Phoenix] If it wasn't for her \ I'd probably be in jail!

[Phoenix] "Wright & Co. Law Offices." \ It's got a good ring to it.

[Phoenix] Yeah!

[Phoenix] Thanks, Maya!

[Mia] (Good luck, Phoenix.)

[Mia] (I'll always be here... \ watching.)

[Maya] Right! Okay, Nick, let's do it!

[Maya] What!? \ Nick, you mean, you don't \ know the Steel Samurai!?

[Maya] He's only the most popular \ TV hero for young people!

[Phoenix] Young...? \ Like, how young?

[Maya] Umm... 10 years old?

[Phoenix] Then what the heck are YOU \ doing getting all excited!?

[Maya] Hey! I'm only 17!

[Maya] That's seven-"teen." See? \ I'm a teen! Not like you, \ Nick.

[Phoenix] Hey! Don't talk to me like I'm \ your grandpa or something. \ I'm only 24 myself.

[Maya] Then watch it with me! \ He's really cool! \ And... it's really popular!

[Maya] When they asked grade school \ kids what they wanted to be, \ "Steel Samurai" was no.1!

[Phoenix] I really worry about kids \ these days.

[Maya] Gramps!

[Maya] Well, the Steel Samurai's \ over. I guess it's time to \ close up the office.

[Phoenix] (Maya's here... \ watching television.)

[TV] Now for the morning news.

[TV] The actor Will Powers \ was arrested yesterday. \ Powers plays the lead role

[TV] in the popular kid's show \ "The Steel Samurai: Warrior \ of Neo Olde Tokyo."

[TV] He was arrested on \ suspicion of murder.

[TV] The victim was Jack Hammer, \ who plays the villain known \ as the "Evil Magistrate."

[TV] His body was found still \ inside the Evil Magistrate \ costume.

[TV] The "Samurai Spear" was also \ found stuck through the body.

[TV] Police believe this was the \ murder weapon, and are \ investigating further.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] This has to be a joke.

[Maya] No, no, no! It's a nightmare! \ The Steel Samurai is over! \ The world is over!

[Phoenix] So what!?

[Maya] So, I've decided this \ will be our first case!

[Maya] You like showing that \ off, don't you, Nick?

[Phoenix] Well, what should we do?

[Maya] What should we do!? \ How can you just sit there \ like that!?

[Maya] We have to get down to the \ detention center and meet \ the Steel Samurai!

[Phoenix] (Does she want to investigate \ this case or just do some \ sightseeing, I wonder?)

[Phoenix] (My money's on sightseeing.)

********************************************

***Talk about "Any ideas"*******************

[Maya] We don't have enough \ information to make \ a case yet.

[Maya] Umm... \ Is that guy really him?

[Phoenix] Whaddya mean "that guy"? \ Of course it's him!

[Phoenix] Will Powers, our client! \ That's him.

[Maya] Um, maybe I shouldn't \ be saying this...

[Maya] But he definitely did it. \ Murder. At least once. \ Maybe twice.

[Phoenix] Whoa whoa whoa! \ What are you saying!?

[Will] Umm...

[Maya] Y-yes!?

[Will] Something wrong...?

[Maya] N-no! No!

[Phoenix] (This is getting off to a \ great start.)

[Will] I know, I know. You're \ disappointed, aren't you?

[Maya] D-disappointed!? Oh, no. \ Oh no.

[Will] No, it's okay. \ This is the real me.

[Will] When I got the part of \ the Steel Samurai, with \ that mask...

[Will] I decided I would never show \ my face in public until the \ job was over.

[Will] It's the kids, you know. \ I didn't want to wreck \ their dreams.

[Maya] Oh...

[Will] I guess it didn't matter.

[Will] So much for dreams.

[Will] I wonder what they think \ of the Steel Samurai now.

[Will] *sniff* \ Uwaaah!

[Phoenix] This guard monitors \ the visitor's room.

[Phoenix] He seems frozen in awe \ of Will Powers.

********************************************

***Present Attorney's Badge*****************

[Phoenix] Um, here.

[Will] I... I see.

[Will] ...

[Phoenix] (Let me guess... this guy \ wasn't the top student \ in improv class.)

********************************************

***Talk about "What happened"***************

[Phoenix] Maybe you could start by \ telling us what happened.

[Will] Y-yes. Of course.

[Will] It seems like it was only \ yesterday. Actually, it was \ only yesterday.

[Will] The cast had come down \ to Global Studios for a \ run-through.

[Will] We went through a few \ action sequences at 10:00 \ that morning.

[Will] There was a rehearsal \ scheduled for 5:00 in the \ afternoon.

[Will] But when 5:00 came around, \ and the staff gathered at \ the studio...

[Will] The Evil Magistrate was \ found lying in a crumpled \ heap near the set.

[Will] They took off his mask...

[Will] And discovered that it was \ Jack Hammer... dead!

[Will] He had been expertly skewered \ with the Samurai Spear.

[Phoenix] The "Samurai Spear"...?

[Will] Yes, it's a long spear \ that I... that the Steel \ Samurai uses as a weapon.

********************************************

***Talk about "The Steel Samurai"***********

[Phoenix] Maybe you could explain to me \ just what "the Steel Samurai" \ is.

[Maya] Nick! \ How could you say such a \ thing?

[Maya] I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize \ for my partner!

[Maya] He's new to this, and a bit \ OUT OF TOUCH with the world.

[Phoenix] Hey! Who's "new to this"!?

[Will] No, it's alright, really.

[Will] The Steel Samurai is the lead \ character in a popular kid's \ show.

[Will] He walks the streets of \ Neo Olde Tokyo...

[Will] Fighting battle after battle \ against the Evil Magistrate \ and his minions.

[Will] Of course, he never really \ defeats the Evil Magistrate.

[Will] Although...

[Will] I guess he did defeat \ him this time...

[Will] *sniff* \ Uwaaah!

[Phoenix] I-I see.

[Phoenix] (Neo Olde Tokyo...? \ Who comes up with \ these names!?)

********************************************

***Talk about "Powers's alibi"**************

[Phoenix] Now, where were you on \ the day of the murder?

[Will] Well, that morning I came \ to studios at 9:00.

[Will] We worked through some \ action scenes until noon.

[Will] Rehearsal was to begin at \ 5:00, but I was a little \ tired.

[Will] So after lunch, I took a nap \ in my dressing room.

[Will] When I woke up, it was \ after 5:00! I was late \ for the rehearsal!

[Will] I hurried to the studio... \ and found everyone looking \ shocked.

[Will] They arrested me on the \ spot, and brought me here.

[Phoenix] (So he was sleeping the entire \ afternoon of the murder?)

[Phoenix] (Some action hero!)

[Will] What will the kids think? \ *sniff*

[] CONTINUE FOR FIRST TIME ONLY

[Phoenix] I think I should probably \ check out the scene of \ the murder...

[Will] Right... Global Studios. \ I'll draw you a map.

[Maya] Wow! Nick! Let's go!

***Talk about "What to do"******************

[Phoenix] Well, what should we do?

[Maya] Sitting around here won't get \ us anywhere, that's for sure.

[Maya] The studio! We should go \ to the studio! I'm sure we \ could find some clues there!

[Phoenix] (Does she want to investigate \ this case or just do some \ sightseeing, I wonder?)

[Phoenix] (My money's on sightseeing.)

[Maya] O-oh... s-sorry!

[Maya] W-we're, um, lawyers.

[Oldbag] Oh yeah? Well that's great. \ I'm security!

[Oldbag] And it's my job to make \ sure that gawkers like \ you stay OUT.

[Maya] G-gawkers?

[Oldbag] Gawkers! Sightseers! \ Tourists!!!

[Oldbag] I know the type. You heard \ about the incident and came \ to snoop around.

[Oldbag] Youths today! Something \ horrible happens and all you \ can think of is sightseeing.

[Oldbag] Wasting your time \ at a place like this.

[Oldbag] Don't you have jobs \ you should be doing?

[Oldbag] Or do lawyers not work like \ the rest of us? Maybe I should \ become a lawyer too. Sounds

[Oldbag] like a life of ease to me no \ work just loafing around all \ day as you please. Well when

[Oldbag] I was young things were a mite \ different, mind you we didn't \ prance around in strange

[Oldbag] hippie clothes. What are the \ youths coming to these days my \ own son hasn't called in...

[Maya] Umm... Nick?

[Maya] Will I grow up to be like \ her? Please say "no."

[Phoenix] I dunno! It's possible.

[Oldbag] Hey!

***Examine computer*************************

[Phoenix] The computer that runs the \ studio security cameras.

[Oldbag] Hey! No touching!

[Oldbag] What's that? \ You giving that to me?

[Phoenix] (Absolutely not!)

********************************************

***Talk about "The studios"*****************

[Phoenix] So, what do you do here \ at the studios?

[Oldbag] At Global Studios, we make \ children's dreams come true!

[Oldbag] In fact, in my \ younger days...

[Maya] No! You were a star!?

[Oldbag] Only a little twinkle \ between the stars here, \ I'm afraid, dearie.

[Maya] Wo... wow.

[Oldbag] This place has really \ gone downhill, you know?

[Oldbag] But 10 years ago, now that \ was a studio of dreams!

[Oldbag] Hammer was a big star back \ then too, he was...

[Phoenix] Hammer...?

[Oldbag] The victim, dummy!

[Oldbag] The Evil Magistrate!

[Oldbag] He's been reduced to playing \ villains now. Not exactly the \ best material to work with...

********************************************

***Talk about "Will Powers"*****************

[Phoenix] Can you tell me about \ Mr. Will Powers?

[Oldbag] He's not a bad kid, but \ don't be fooled by his mask!

[Oldbag] You wouldn't want him on \ the silver screen without \ it, believe me.

[Oldbag] Little old ladies watching \ would lose their lunch!

[Oldbag] That's probably why he thought \ that the Steel Samurai was \ his "big chance."

[Oldbag] No one thought he was \ capable of doing what he \ did to poor Jack Hammer...

[Maya] We don't know for certain \ that Will Powers is guilty!

[Oldbag] Powers? Of course he's guilty!

[Oldbag] How do I know? \ I know everything! \ That's my job.

********************************************

***Talk about "Mr. Hammer"******************

[Phoenix] What kind of person \ was Jack Hammer?

[Oldbag] What "kind of person"? \ Oh... if you only knew!

[Oldbag] Jack Hammer will live on \ in many hearts as the \ ultimate action hero!

[Oldbag] He was simply dashing \ in the Dynamite Samurai \ series!

[Phoenix] (Should I have heard \ of that...?)

[Oldbag] But... there was an accident \ during filming five years ago.

[Oldbag] He got an unlucky break \ after that.

[Oldbag] Reduced to playing the villain \ on a children's program!

[Oldbag] What's more, I heard they \ were paying him peanuts. \ It's enough to make you cry.

********************************************

***Talk about "Reason for suspicion"********

[Phoenix] Why are you so certain \ Mr. Powers is the killer?

[Oldbag] I was standing right \ here yesterday, I was.

[Oldbag] I was here from 1:00 in \ the afternoon, to 5:00, \ when they found the body!

[Oldbag] Now the studio where the \ murder took place is to \ the left here.

[Oldbag] So if you want to go to \ the studio, you have to \ pass by me!

[Oldbag] Only one person went by here \ between 1:00 and 2:30, when \ the murder took place!

[Phoenix] And... that person \ was Mr. Powers?

[Oldbag] Yes. \ I saw him!

[Phoenix] But Mr. Powers says he was \ sleeping in his dressing room.

[Oldbag] Oh, I'm sure he would \ say that. He's no fool!

[Oldbag] But he was the only \ one that walked by.

[Oldbag] He's the killer, you can \ bet your biscuits on it.

********************************************

[] AFTER TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING

[Oldbag] Isn't it about time for \ you to be heading home?

[Oldbag] There's nothing to see here. \ Move along.

[Phoenix] Um, actually, we're here \ at Mr. Powers's request.

[Oldbag] Hmph! I thought you were \ suspicious lookin'!

[Oldbag] Show me a "letter of \ request."

[Oldbag] And maybe I'll just \ let you in.

[Maya] This lady here thinks \ she owns this place, \ obviously.

[] MOVE TO: Detention Center

[Will] Hello! \ How was the studio?

[Will] They all think I did it, \ don't they?

[Maya] N-no, not at all! \ Isn't that right, Nick?

[Phoenix] Right, not at all. \ At worst, you're a suspect.

[Will] *sniff*

[] ...

***Talk about "Your alibi"******************

[Phoenix] Mr. Powers, you aren't \ hiding anything from \ me, are you?

[Will] W-what? \ No! I'd never do that!

[Phoenix] Just now you said that you \ were sleeping in your dressing \ room after lunch.

[Will] Yes. \ Like a baby.

[Phoenix] But the security lady \ said she saw you that day.

[Phoenix] She says she saw you heading \ towards the scene of the \ crime!

[Will] W-what!? That's not possible!

[Will] I... I really don't know \ what to say! I was sleeping, \ I promise!

[Phoenix] Mr. Powers, if you want me \ to help you, you have to \ tell me the truth.

[Phoenix] I'm new to this lawyer \ business, and I need every \ advantage I can get.

[Will] I know... I-I'm sorry. \ *sniff*

[Will] But, I swear to you on my \ momma's grave, I was sleeping.

[Will] Maybe the security lady \ only thought she saw me?

[Phoenix] (What did she see...? \ He doesn't seem to be lying.)

********************************************

***Talk about "The security lady"***********

[Phoenix] Umm... about the security \ guard at the main gate \ to the studio...

[Will] Oh, the security lady?

[Maya] She's terrible! She called me \ "suspicious lookin'"!

[Will] Y-yes... actually, she's said \ the same thing to me before.

[Will] "Take off that mask!" were \ her words, I believe.

[Will] She sucks up to all the \ bigwigs at the studio...

[Will] But let her see you stumble \ once and she'll never let \ up on you.

[Maya] Grr! She's got some nerve!

[] CONTINUE FOR FIRST TIME ONLY

[Phoenix] Do you think you ould write \ up a letter formally \ requesting my representation?

[Phoenix] This is the studio where they \ found Jack Hammer's body.

[Maya] Let's go in and check \ it out, Nick!

[Maya] ...

[Maya] Hey! It's locked!

[Phoenix] Looks like you need a \ cardkey to get in.

[Phoenx] It makes sense that they \ would want to keep the \ non-employees out.

********************************************

***Present Attorney's Badge*****************

[Phoenix] Detective, see this? \ This is my attorney's badge.

[Gumshoe] Uh huh?

[Gumshoe] Don'tcha think it's a little \ sad when you have to explain \ what your badge means, pal?

[Gumshoe] Real men show their P.D. \ badge and that's that!

[Phoenix] I'll admit the design of \ my badge leaves a lot to \ be desired...

[Maya] Maybe it should just be \ a big "L" for "Lawyer"?

[Phoenix] Hmm... I'm not so \ sure about that.

********************************************

***Present other****************************

[Phoenix] Um, Detective. \ Any ideas about this?

[Gumshoe] Look, I don't got time to \ look at every little trinket \ you got, okay pal?

********************************************

***Talk about "The investigation"***********

[Phoenix] So, how is your investigation \ going, Detective?

[Gumshoe] Well, it's... Hey! I can't \ tell you that, pal.

[Maya] Nick...

[Maya] Maybe you need to be a little \ more indirect with your \ questions?

[Phoenix] Right. \ So, Detective, mind if I take \ a look at what you got?

[Gumshoe] What I got?

[Phoenix] The autopsy report! \ The latest version, if \ you please...

[Gumshoe] Hmm... right, right.

[Gumshoe] Sorry about what happened \ last time, pal.

[] Autopsy Report added to \ the Court Record.

********************************************

***Talk about "The investigation" again*****

[Phoenix] So, how is your investigation \ going, Detective?

[Gumshoe] I'm not at liberty to give \ you any more information, pal.

[Gumshoe] You'll hear all you \ need to know in court!

[Phoenix] (Oh well, it was \ worth a try.)

********************************************

***Talk about "Reason for arrest"***********

[Phoenix] Why was Mr. Powers arrested?

[Gumshoe] Simple, pal!

[Gumshoe] The murder took place right \ over there in Studio One.

[Gumshoe] Now, the victim entered \ Studio One at approximately \ 1:00 PM.

[Gumshoe] At that time, there was no \ one other than the victim \ in the studio.

[Gumshoe] According to the autopsy report, \ the time of death was 2:30 PM.

[Gumshoe] Only one person went to the \ studio between 1:00 and 2:30!

[Gumshoe] And that person was none \ other than Will Powers!

[Gumshoe] No one else, pal!

[Gumshoe] If you think I'm lying, \ ask the security lady \ at the main gate.

[Maya] Nick! If that's true...!

[Maya] Anyone would think that \ Powers did it with that \ kind of evidence!

[Phoenix] Thanks for cheering me up...

********************************************

***Talk about "The Security Lady"***********

[Phoenix] About the security lady...

[Gumshoe] Oh, that sweet old lady. \ What a charmer!

[Phoenix] Huh? \ A-are we talking about \ the same person?

[Gumshoe] When I showed her my badge \ she gave me a donut and \ some coffee!

[Maya] Remember what Powers said. \ She's a sucker for authority.

[Gumshoe] She even gave me a piece \ of valuable evidence!

[Maya] Whaat!?

********************************************

***Talk about "Decisive evidence"***********

[Phoenix] What kind of evidence!?

[Gumshoe] Well, that, er, photo.

[Gumshoe] The photo of the Steel Samurai \ heading toward the scene \ of the crime!

[Maya] What! \ Who took that!?

[Gumshoe] See the camera up \ on that gate, pal?

[Maya] The gate? You mean the \ one with the welcome sign?

[Gumshoe] Yeah. Whenever someone walks \ by, that camera automatically \ snaps a photo of them!

[Maya] Oh no!

[Maya] Nick, he has evidence! \ We're finished!

[Phoenix] (Funny, for someone with \ hard proof he doesn't look \ too happy.)

[Gumshoe] ...

********************************************

[] AFTER TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING

[Gumshoe] What's wrong, pal? \ You seem down.

[Phoenix] Don't look so happy \ when you say that.

[Gumshoe] Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh!

[Maya] Umm...

[Maya] We'd like to ask the employees \ here some questions...

[Gumshoe] Sure thing, pal.

[Gumshoe] Go wherever you like.

[Gumshoe] Of course, you're not going \ to find any clues I haven't \ already found! Hah hah hah!

[Phoenix] (I'm glad someone around \ here seems to be enjoying \ themselves.)

[Maya] Nick, let's go!

[Maya] We've got a free pass to \ the place. Now's our chance \ to check things out!

[] MOVE TO: Studio - Main Gate

[] ...

[Maya] Nick! Look!

[Maya] That security lady is in the \ guard station stuffing her \ face with donuts!

[Maya] I guess all cops like \ their donuts!

[Phoenix] Yeah, and they're soft \ enough she doesn't need \ teeth to chew them...

[Oldbag] Hey, you!

[Oldbag] Well? Are you satisfied \ Powers is guilty yet?

[Phoenix] (Urk!)

[Phoenix] (She had to make my life \ harder by giving that photo \ to Detective Gumshoe...)

[] ...

***Talk about "Photographic proof"**********

[Phoenix] Why didn't you tell \ us about the security \ photo, ma'am?

[Oldbag] Hmm? Oh, that?

[Oldbag] I just thought it would be \ more thrilling to talk \ with the detective himself!

[Oldbag] These things are important, \ you know.

[Oldbag] Oh, just to the left from \ here is the gate with the \ camera that took that photo.

[Oldbag] It's my job to check the \ photos every day, you see.

********************************************

***Talk about "Reason for suspicion"********

[Oldbag] This guard station is in a \ central position.

[Oldbag] No matter where you go here, \ you pass by my station first!

[Oldbag] Now poor Hammer, he went to \ the studio just before 1:00.

[Oldbag] The murder happened right \ around 2:30, see?

[Oldbag] The only one I seen go through \ here between 1:00 and 2:30 \ was Powers himself!

[Oldbag] The security camera got \ a good look at him too.

[Oldbag] If he's not the one what \ did it, I don't know who is!

[Phoenix] Maybe... it was you?

[Oldbag] Gyah hah ha hah! \ Good one, sonny.

[Phoenix] (She thinks I was joking.)

********************************************

***Talk about "Mr. Hammer"******************

[Phoenix] Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, \ a popular actor?

[Oldbag] Oh, he was the biggest \ star in the studio!

[Phoenix] ("Was"? Past tense?)

[Maya] Oh yes! He was great as \ the "Bearded Samurai"!

[Oldbag] That too, yes.

[Oldbag] He shone the brightest! \ Back in the day.

[Oldbag] Making a star like him play \ the "Evil Magistrate"... \ It's a disgrace, I tell you!

[Oldbag] Hammer took it pretty hard, \ and who can blame him?

********************************************

***Talk about "Automatic camera"************

[Phoenix] About the security camera...

[Oldbag] Oh yes, the camera.

[Oldbag] It's automatic. It can tell \ when someone walks through \ that gate, see?

[Oldbag] Then it snaps a photo!

[Oldbag] Apparently, it records the \ time when it takes a picture \ too.

[Oldbag] But I don't bother myself \ with those details.

[Oldbag] I just view all the photos \ on the computer over in the \ security guard station.

[Oldbag] I check 'em every day before \ going home, I do.

********************************************

[] MOVE TO: Wright & Co.Law Offices

[] ...

[] October 16 \ Wright & Co. Law Offices

[Maya] What's going on, Nick!?

[Maya] Powers said he was sleeping \ in his dressing room!

[Maya] But now there's a photo \ of him going to the studio!?

[Phoenix] Don't look at me! \ How should I know?

[] ...

***Talk about "What to do"******************

[Phoenix] What do you think?

[Maya] That photo the detective was \ talking about is the problem \ here.

[Phoenix] Well, that's hard to say, \ without seeing the actual \ photo ourselves.

[Phoenix] But if it is Powers in that \ photo, his alibi is shot.

********************************************

***Talk about "Photographic proof"**********

[Phoenix] Only one person went to the \ scene of the crime before \ the murder took place.

[Phoenix] And there's a photograph \ to prove it.

[Maya] I guess it makes sense \ that that person is the \ killer then.

[Maya] What do we do, Nick?

[Phoenix] Maybe there was someone else \ who could have gone to the \ scene other than Powers?

[Phoenix] Let's take a look.

[Phoenix] Maybe that security lady \ missed someone?

[Maya] On thing's for sure, if \ there are any clues, they'll \ be in that studio.

********************************************

[] MOVE TO: Detention Center

[] ...

[] October 16 \ Detention Center \ Visitor's Room

[Phoenix] ...

[Maya] Apparently they have \ Mr. Powers in questioning.

[Phoenix] Hmm... right.

[Gumshoe] Look pal, that camera takes \ a picture automatically \ whenever someone walks by.

[Gumshoe] And it took a picture \ of Will Powers!

[Phoenix] I have to ask him \ about that photograph!

[Maya] Oh well. \ Let's try again later.

[] ...

***Examine security guard*******************

[Phoenix] This guard monitors \ the visitor's room.

[Phoenix] He must get pretty bored.

[Phoenix] I bet he's making funny \ faces at that camera.

********************************************

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] This is where they do all \ the behind-the-scenes stuff!

[Maya] Hey! Look! There's Powers's \ dressing room!

[Maya] No one's here this soon \ after the murder I guess.

[Maya] Let's take a look around!

[] ...

***Examine dressing room door***************

[Phoenix] The door to the dressing room. \ It's not locked.

[Maya] Hey, Nick! \ Let's take a look inside!

[Maya] Maybe we can find something \ as a souvenir...?

[Phoenix] What do you mean "find"!?

[Maya] You never know! There might \ be something like... the \ Samurai Spear!

[Phoenix] We don't need a spear!

[Phoenix] (And that's the murder \ weapon for crying out loud!)

********************************************

***Examine sign*****************************

[Phoenix] There's a sign on the \ dressing room door.

[Phoenix] "Mr. Will Powers"... it must \ be neat to be the star and \ have your own room like this.

********************************************

***Examine vending machine******************

[Phoenix] Let's see... cola, candy, \ chips, gum...

[Phoenix] Huh. It's so... normal.

[Phoenix] I was expecting some cool \ theme snacks or something. \ Popcorn, at least!

[Maya] W-wait! Look! \ "Samurai Soda"!

[Maya] Nick! Try this!

[Phoenix] (Ladies first...)

********************************************

***Examine dressing room window*************

[Phoenix] A window into the \ dressing room.

[Phoenix] The glass is frosted, \ so I can't see inside.

********************************************

***Examine storage room door****************

[Phoenix] That must be the storage room.

[Phoenix] That's where they keep \ all the film equipment.

[Maya] Wow, Nick! You know a lot \ about the industry!

[Phoenix] Umm, what else would they \ keep in a film studio?

********************************************

***Examine nearest table********************

[Phoenix] The remains of yesterday's \ lunch are scattered around.

[Phoenix] Everyone was probably too \ shocked to clean up.

[Phoenix] There's a t-bone on one of \ the plates, minus the steak.

[Maya] Mmm! T-bone steak! \ That would have hit the spot.

[Phoenix] You just had a burger!

[Maya] Yeah, but I have a second \ stomach just for steaks.

[Phoenix] (What!?)

********************************************

***Examine bicycle**************************

[Phoenix] Looks like one of those \ electric-powered bicycles.

[Phoenix] I dunno about these. \ I mean, what's the point?

[Maya] It makes it a lot easier \ to go up hills!

[Phoenix] Don't people cycle to \ get exercise!?

********************************************

***Examine backdrop*************************

[Phoenix] There's a half-finished \ backdrop for a stage here.

[Phoenix] Looks like a castle.

[Phoenix] Probably "Neo Olde \ Tokyo Castle."

********************************************

***Examine open grate***********************

[Phoenix] The metal grate on the drain \ here has been taken off.

[Phoenix] That's a pretty big drain. \ A kid could fit through \ there, I bet.

[Maya] Yeah, if you snuck in that \ way you wouldn't have to \ pay at the gate!

[Phoenix] Well, if you want to leave \ that way, be my guest.

[Maya] Right!

[Maya] Huh? \ Hey! I'm not a kid!

[Phoenix] (Powers's dressing room...)

[Phoenix] (So this is where he \ was sleeping?)

[Phoenix] (Or at least, this is where \ he claims he was sleeping.)

[Maya] No one actually saw him \ taking a nap here, did they?

[Phoenix] Right, and there's a picture \ of him near the crime scene.

[Phoenix] (I hope he's telling the \ truth... for his sake!)

[] ...

***Examine window***************************

[Phoenix] It's locked.

[Phoenix] Looks like he doesn't \ open his window much.

[Phoenix] I guess it is kind of \ dusty outside.

********************************************

***Examine sofa*****************************

[Phoenix] Looks like someone \ was sleeping here.

[Phoenix] Maybe Powers did take \ a nap here yesterday...

********************************************

***Examine table****************************

[Phoenix] There's a bunch of snacks on \ the table. They must give \ these to the employees.

[Phoenix] Some tea and cookies...

[Maya] Nick... \ I'm hungry!

[Phoenix] You just had a burger!

[Maya] Yeah, but I have a separate \ stomach for sweets!

[Phoenix] (How many stomachs does \ this girl have!?)

********************************************

***Examine costumes*************************

[Phoenix] There's some regular suits \ in among the costumes here.

[Phoenix] Those must be his own clothes.

[Maya] It'd be fun to wear one \ of the costumes...

[Phoenix] (I'd say you were already \ wearing one, myself.)

********************************************

***Examine mirror***************************

[Phoenix] They always have mirrors \ like this in dressing rooms.

[Phoenix] I see my hair is still nice \ and spiky, just how I like it.

********************************************

***Examine cosmetics************************

[Phoenix] There's a vast array of \ cosmetics here.

[Maya] Ooh!

[Maya] This is the wig he used \ in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"!

[Maya] Nick! Try this on!

[Phoenix] No.

[Phoenix] And how can you tell the name \ of a show just by looking \ at a wig!?

[Maya] I, um, kinda like \ samurai movies.

[Phoenix] ("Kinda"...?)

********************************************

***Examine bag******************************

[Maya] Hmm? This must be \ Powers's bag.

[Phoenix] Hey, don't open that.

[Maya] Look!

[Phoenix] An employee cardkey. \ That must be Powers's.

[Phoenix] It says "Studio One."

[Maya] Let's take it, Nick!

[Phoenix] Borrow it. You mean borrow.

[] Cardkey added to \ the Court Record.

[Oldbag] Oh that! Isn't that \ a studio cardkey?

[Oldbag] You better watch it!

[Oldbag] The scene of a murder is \ no place for sightseeing!

[Oldbag] I'll be taking that! \ Hand it over!

[Phoenix] W-wait! \ No, that's mine!

[Oldbag] Look, I don't have a cardkey \ to the studio, see?

[Oldbag] I want to go pay my respects \ to Jack Hammer where he died.

[Maya] ...

[Phoenix] You're real quiet all \ of a sudden.

[Maya] Doesn't it give \ you the shivers, Nick?

[Maya] That white tape! \ It's so... so real!

[Phoenix] Well, the Evil Magistrate \ did die here.

[Phoenix] And the Steel Samurai \ killed him.

[Phoenix] The murder weapon was the \ Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty \ real to me...

[] ...

***Examine backdrop*************************

[Phoenix] Looks like a backdrop \ for a stage.

[Phoenix] This must be used in \ the Steel Samurai show.

[Maya] Of course! That's the \ mountain, Neo Fujiyama!

[Phoenix] Doesn't the Steel Samurai take \ place in Olde Tokyo? Can you \ even see Mt. Fuji from there?

[Maya] Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! \ "Neo" Olde Tokyo!

[Phoenix] Oh. \ Right.

********************************************

***Examine white board**********************

[Maya] What's this?

[Pheonix] That's for reflecting light. \ They call it a reflecting \ screen or something like that.

[Phoenix] The assistant holds it \ during filming.

[Maya] Huh.

[Phoenix] What? Where's your \ enthusiasm for all \ things entertainment?

[Maya] Well, lighting is fine, but \ I'd want to be the director. \ Or maybe the Steel Samurai!

[Phoenix] (I think she's being \ serious...!)

********************************************

[Maya] Hey! Look! That's the chair \ the director sits in!

[Maya] I've always wanted to \ sit in one of these.

[Maya] Hey Nick, take a \ look at that.

[Maya] One of those black-and-white \ boards they clap at the start \ of filming!

[Maya] And look! A megaphone! \ A real live megaphone!

[Phoenix] ...

[Maya] Ready, Nick? \ Action!

[Phoenix] (This girl is more \ troubled than I thought...)

********************************************

***Examine ladder***************************

[Maya] Look, a ladder!

[Maya] So? What's the difference?

[Maya] You need to stop judging \ things based on narrow-minded \ cultural assumptions, Nick!

[Phoenix] R-right... sorry. \ (This girl is OUT there!)

********************************************

***Examine body outline*********************

[Phoenix] They outlined where Jack \ Hammer's body lay with tape.

[Phoenix] His body was found still \ inside the Evil Magistrate \ costume.

[Phoenix] I guess that's why the head \ part looks like a helmet.

[Phoenix] Funny, I expected a spear \ stabbing would leave at \ least a few bloodstains.

[Phoenix] I guess the costume must \ have absorbed most of it...

********************************************

***Examine cameras**************************

[Maya] Wow, look at that camera! \ That must cost a ton!

[Phoenix] Yeah! So don't touch it!

[Phoenix] Could you tell me anything \ about the day of the murder?

[Penny] Yes. I was in the studio \ the whole day.

[Penny] I was the only assistant \ on staff that day, you see.

[Maya] Only one assistant!?

[Penny] Yes, well, the studios aren't \ doing so well right now.

[Penny] And yesterday was only \ rehearsal for our action \ sequences.

[Maya] I see. Neat!

[Penny] In the morning we went through \ the action sequences in the \ employee area.

[Penny] WP and Hammer were there, \ along with everyone else.

[Phoenix] The employee area--that's \ where Powers's dressing \ room is, right?

[Penny] Yes, that's the place.

[Penny] After eating lunch there, \ Mr. Hammer went to Studio One.

[Penny] Then I saw WP go into \ his dressing room.

[Phoenix] Hmm...

[Penny] Umm...

[Penny] Sorry... I know \ you're busy.

[Phoenix] Not really.

[Penny] Actually, there's been \ something bothering me.

[Maya] Ah hah!

[Maya] That's what I'm talking about! \ A clue! A lead!

[Penny] Well, I don't know about that, \ but that day, just after noon, \ I sensed someone was here...

[Phoenix] You "sensed"?

[Penny] Yes, several times.

[Phoenix] Some other studio employees, \ maybe?

[Penny] No, I don't think so.

[Penny] The only thing we had \ scheduled was an action \ scene run-through.

[Penny] I was the only assistant \ here that day.

[Penny] I have a feeling it was \ someone from... outside.

[Phoenix] R-really!?

[Maya] But wait, if someone \ had come in here...

[Maya] Wouldn't that security \ lady have noticed them?

[Phoenix] And the estimated time of \ Hammer's death was 2:30.

[Phoenix] Are you sure that Powers \ was the only one to go through \ here between those times?

[Oldbag] Sure as can be!

[] AFTER OBTAINING PHOTO

[Maya] Hey, hey, Nick!

[Maya] Can't we use this photo \ as evidence for the trial?

[Phoenix] Yeah.

[Maya] We'll put that security \ lady in her place with this!

[Phoenix] Right, we'll put her in her \ place...

[Maya] Hey, that's what I said! \ Anyway...

[Maya] Let's show her this photo \ and see what she says!

[Phoenix] Wait. Let's not.

[Maya] Why not?

[Phoenix] It's never a good idea to \ reveal your hand to the \ enemy too soon.

[Maya] Nick! You're craftier than \ I gave you credit for.

[Maya] Why, you could be the next... \ Evil Magistrate!

[Phoenix] Hey! Why do I have \ to be the villain.

[Maya] Relax, it was just a joke! \ So, are we done for today?

[Phoenix] I think this photo is \ what we needed for the \ trial.

[Phoenix] Still, it'd be better if we \ had some idea who the real \ killer was!

[Phoenix] Maybe it really is \ that security lady...?

[] ...

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green October 18, 10:00 AM \ District Court \ Courtroom No. 4

[Judge] The court is now in \ session for the trial \ of Mr. Will Powers.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution is ready, \ Your Honor.

[Phoenix] The defense is ready, \ Your Honor.

[Judge] Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your \ opening statement, please.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution will show the \ court that at 2:30 PM \ on October 15, the defendant,

[Edgeworth] Mr. Will Powers, killed \ fellow actor Jack Hammer at \ Studio One of Global Studios.

[Edgeworth] It is impossible for anyone \ else to have committed this \ heinous crime.

[Edgeworth] The evidence presented \ during the trial will all \ point to this fact.

[Judge] Hmm. I see.

[Judge] Very well, I would like to \ move on to your testimony.

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution \ may call its first witness.

[Edgeworth] First, I would like to call \ a familiar face, Detective \ Gumshoe, to the stand.

[] ...

[Edgeworth] Detective, if you would \ briefly describe this case \ to the court?

[Gumshoe] Yes sir! \ I'll explain with the \ guidemap here.

[] RETURN HERE FROM BELOW

[Gumshoe] To understand this case, it's \ important to grasp the layout \ of the studios, see?

[Gumshoe] This here is the Employee \ Area.

[Gumshoe] The actors did a run-through \ of their action scenes during \ the morning here.

[Gumshoe] This is the main gate to the \ studios.

[Gumshoe] The security lady that works \ at the studios was here at \ 1:00 PM on that day.

[Gumshoe] Past the security station \ there is a gate, see?

[Gumshoe] Past that are the studios.

[Gumshoe] And here it is... \ Studio One.

[Gumshoe] This is the scene of the \ murder, where the body \ was found!

[Gumshoe] Now, on the day of the \ murder, October 15, there \ were only three people here.

[] Gumshoe \ The victim, Jack Hammer,

[Gumshoe] the defendant, Will Powers,

[Gumshoe] and a young woman, the \ production assistant.

[Gumshoe] All the production staff \ were in the Employee Area \ until noon.

[Gumshoe] Then after lunch, the victim, \ Jack Hammer, went to \ Studio One.

[Gumshoe] Right after that, at 1:00 PM, \ the security lady got to the \ guard station.

[Gumshoe] Now, jump ahead to later \ that day... 5:00 PM.

[Gumshoe] The production staff came \ to Studio One to perform a \ rehearsal.

[Gumshoe] Needless to say, the rehearsal \ was cancelled...

[Gumshoe] The time of death was \ 2:30 PM.

[Gumshoe] The "Samurai Spear" found \ lodged in the victim's chest \ was the murder weapon.

[Gumshoe] That's the case, in brief.

[Gumshoe] Anyone like to hear \ that again?

[Phoenix] (Hmm... should I listen to \ that whole thing again...?)

***Skip it**********************************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Listen again*****************************

[Phoenix] I'm sorry, could you describe \ that one more time?

[Gumshoe] I shoulda known it would \ be you, pal!

[Gumshoe] Fine. Once more for the \ mentally-challenged lawyer.

[Phoenix] (Yeah, yeah. Live it up \ while you can, Gumshoe.)

[] RETURN TO RETURN POINT (LABELED ABOVE)

********************************************

[Phoenix] (I think I can probably \ remember that...)

[Judge] So the murder weapon \ was a "spear"?

[Judge] How... medieval!

[] Samurai Spear added \ to the Court Record.

[Edgeworth] Your Honor.

[Edgeworth] This case is quite simple \ if you ask one question:

[Edgeworth] And that question is:

[Edgeworth] "What did the security lady \ at the guard station see?"

[Judge] Understood.

[Edgeworth] Let's call this security \ officer to the stand!

[] ...

[Edgeworth] Will the witness declare \ her name?

[Oldbag] ...

[Oldbag] Hmm?

[Oldbag] My, aren't you \ a handsome fellow!

[Oldbag] I'm afraid I'm a bit \ flustered!

[Edgeworth] Y-your name, please!

[Oldbag] Oh, dearie! No need for \ you to be embarrassed! \ Just call me "grandma."

[Edgeworth] YOUR NAME, PLEASE!

[Phoenix] (Seems Edgeworth has a bit of \ trouble getting his witnesses \ to say their names...)

[Oldbag] Wendy Oldbag, dearie.

[Oldbag] So just call me "grandma." \ It's practically my name!

[Oldbag] So even when I was young I \ was an Oldbag, but not really \ that was just my name dearie.

[Oldbag] Still how the other children \ would make fun of me and just \ because of my name can you

[Oldbag] believe it? But there was this \ boy, the captain of the chess \ club in junior high, and when

[Oldbag] he called me an old bag well \ I just cried and cried because \ I had a crush on him you see--

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] O-objection! I... object to \ the witness's talkativeness.

[Judge] Objection sustained!

[Judge] The witness will refrain \ from rambling on the stand.

[Oldbag] I was just getting to \ the good part, dearie!

[Edgeworth] Perhaps we can get to the \ testimony?

[Judge] Now, the witness was stationed \ at the main gate on the day \ of the murder, correct?

[Oldbag] Yessey I was.

[Judge] And to get to the scene of \ the murder, someone would \ have to pass by you?

[Oldbag] You know your stuff, dearie!

[Judge] ...

[Judge] You may begin your testimony.

[Phoenix] (She sure is one hell of \ an Oldbag...)

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Witness's Account --

[Oldbag] (1) \ On the day of the murder, \ I arrived at the guard \ station at 1:00 PM.

[Oldbag] (2) \ Poor old Hammer and the rest \ had been doing a run-through \ there since the morning.

[Oldbag] (3) \ I, well, I had some errands \ to run that morning.

[Oldbag] (4) \ Anyway, it was 1:00 when \ I got to the guard station.

[Oldbag] (5) \ I was at the main gate \ from then until 5:00!

[Oldbag] (6) \ Now, the murder happened \ at 2:30 PM, right?

[Oldbag] (7) \ Interesting to me, because a \ certain man walked right by \ me at 2:00 PM.

[Oldbag] (8) \ It was Powers! \ That man right there, and he \ was heading toward the studio!

[] ...

[Judge] You saw the defendant, then? \ Hmm...

[Judge] Very well. Let's begin the \ cross-examination. Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Witness's Account --

[Oldbag] (1) \ On the day of the murder, \ I arrived at the guard \ station at 1:00 PM.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So up until that time, \ anyone who wanted to \ could go into the studio?

[Oldbag] Well, there wasn't a security \ guard at the gate, no.

[Oldbag] But the main gate \ was locked, dearie.

[Oldbag] You'd need an employee \ cardkey to get in.

[Phoenix] (Right... the cardkey \ that I have.)

[Phoenix] (So, what she's saying is \ no one who wasn't supposed \ to be there could get in.)

[Edgeworth] Was there anyone at the \ studios when you arrived \ at the guard station?

[Oldbag] (2) \ Poor old Hammer and the rest \ had been doing a run-through \ there since the morning.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] A "run-through"...?

[Oldbag] They were working out a scene \ between the Steel Samurai \ and the Evil Magistrate.

[Oldbag] They got the basics figured \ out by noon, and were to use \ the afternoon for practice.

[Oldbag] Rehearsal was supposed \ to start at 5:00.

[Oldbag] That's why poor old Hammer \ went to Studio One in the \ afternoon.

[Phoenix] (So Powers was in his dressing \ room sleeping... when he was \ supposed to be practicing!)

[Phoenix] (Talk about a laid-back \ hero...)

[Edgeworth] If there was a run-through in \ the morning, why did you \ only get there after noon?

[Oldbag] (3) \ I, well, I had some errands \ to run that morning.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What kind of "errands"?

[Oldbag] Oh, well, you know.

[Phoenix] Answer the question!

[Oldbag] Actually... I was watching \ poor Hammer and Powers. \ Observing, you know?

[Phoenix] O-observing? \ Weren't you supposed to \ be at the guard station?

[Oldbag] Whippersnapper! I told you \ I locked the gate, didn't I? \ I did my job!

[Phoenix] (I'm not sure your boss \ would see it that way...)

[Oldbag] Anyway!

[Oldbag] I always watch Hammer's \ run-throughts. Always!

[Oldbag] Never missed one \ in all my years.

[Maya] Wow! I want to see a Steel \ Samurai run-through too!

[Phoenix] You could quit being a spirit \ medium and take up guard duty.

[Maya] Not a bad idea...

[Oldbag] (4) \ Anyway, it was 1:00 when \ I got to the guard station.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Did you see the victim then?

[Oldbag] Did I see poor old Hammer? \ Nope.

[Oldbag] He'd already gone to the \ studio before I got back \ to the guard station.

[Edgeworth] Tell us what happened next.

[Oldbag] (5) \ I was at the main gate \ from then until 5:00!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So you were watching there \ the WHOLE time? No breaks? \ Not even a second?

[Oldbag] O-of course! \ I am a professional, you know!

[Oldbag] Our are you criticizing how \ I do my job!? Whippersnapper!

[Phoenix] No, it's just, after seeing \ you eating those donuts in \ the guard station yesterday...

[Oldbag] I can watch the gate and eat \ donuts at the same time!

[Oldbag] Snipperwhapper!

[Maya] "Snipperwhapper"...?

[Maya] Old windbag is losing \ it, Nick.

[Phoenix] Why don't you raise an \ objection?

[Judge] So, the witness was on duty \ through the afternoon, \ the whole time. Very well.

[Judge] What did you see?

[Oldbag] (6) \ Now, the murder happened \ at 2:30 PM, right?

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] How did you know that?

[Oldbag] Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! \ That over-dressed young \ detective told me.

[Oldbag] I fed him some donuts and \ he talked and talked...

[Oldbag] If you ask me, that detective \ isn't cut out for his job.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Phoenix] (Poor Detective Gumshoe, \ getting chewed out by a \ security guard...)

[Oldbag] (7) \ Interesting to me, because a \ certain man walked right by \ me at 2:00 PM.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] 2:00? You're sure?

[Oldbag] Sure as spit!

[Judge] Well, who was the man!?

[Oldbag] Really, you should try not to \ get so excited at your age. \ You might strain something.

[Judge] ...

[Oldbag] Now, now, don't get your \ skivvies all in a bunch. \ I'll tell you who it was!

[Oldbag] (8) \ It was Powers! \ That man right there, and he \ was heading toward the studio!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So you saw Mr. Powers?

[Oldbag] That's what I said! \ Got wax in your ears, sonny?

[Maya] Nick, this is your chance!

[Phoenix] Yeah, time to pull out \ the secret weapon...

[Oldbag] I'll say it again! \ It was him!

[Maya] Nick...

[Maya] Doesn't she seem like she's \ enjoying this a little too \ much?

[Phoenix] Windbags love gossiping about \ other people's misfortunes.

[Maya] Ugh. Can't she get her \ kicks somewhere else?

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Let me get this straight, \ old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!

[Phoenix] You've been saying since \ yesterday that you "saw \ Mr. Powers," correct?

[Phoenix] But you're talking about \ the man in this photo, \ aren't you!

[Judge] J-just a moment, \ Mr. Wright.

[Judge] Let me see that photo!

[Judge] ...

[Judge] What is this, exactly?

[Phoenix] None other than the Steel \ Samurai, defender of \ Neo Olde Tokyo.

[Phoenix] Ms. Oldbag!

[Phoenix] Is this the "Mr. Powers" \ that you saw!?

[Oldbag] Of course! Didn't your momma \ teach you any sense, sonny?

[Oldbag] Anyone can plainly see \ that's Powers! Right?

[Edgeworth] Um, yeah.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Umm... well. \ I wonder?

[Phoenix] True, Mr. Powers does play \ the role of the Steel Samurai!

[Phoenix] But that doesn't mean Mr. \ Powers IS the Steel Samurai!

[Oldbag] ...!

[Oldbag] I... I know that! \ I wasn't born yesterday!

[Judge] No one in this court is \ accusing you of that, \ Ms... er, witness.

[Phoenix] (He's having trouble calling \ her "Oldbag" apparently...)

[Judge] However, you do not have proof \ that the person in this photo \ is Mr. Will Powers, do you?

[Oldbag] Humph! \ Nosy old man!

[Oldbag] Of course I have proof!

[Phoenix] What!?

[Edgeworth] Huh!?

[Phoenix] (Even Edgeworth is \ surprised!?)

[Edgeworth] The prosecution would like \ to ask the old... the witness.

[Edgeworth] Please make known all the \ information in your \ possession ahead of time!

[Oldbag] How was I to know everyone \ would be so nosy! You should \ be ashamed, all of you!

[Oldbag] Anyway, I showed that photo \ to the young detective.

[Oldbag] He told me "this isn't any \ good as evidence, pal."

[Oldbag] He didn't even give it \ a second look!

[Edgeworth] ...

[Phoenix] (Wow, old windbag has left \ even Edgeworth speechless. \ She's good!)

[Judge] Let's hear about your \ proof, then.

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ --The Man in the Photo--

[Oldbag] (1) \ I never say anything \ I don't mean, mind you!

[Oldbag] (2) \ That morning, during the \ run-through of the action \ scene...

[Oldbag] (3) \ I saw Powers trip and fall!

[Oldbag] (4) \ He broke one of the props, \ it was a big mess.

[Oldbag] (5) \ Apparently, he sprained \ his ankle pretty bad.

[Oldbag] Now, look at that picture!

[Oldbag] (6) \ You can see he's dragging \ his leg! See? Clear as day!

[Oldbag] (7) \ That's how I knew it \ was Powers. Happy?

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm. So he had sprained \ his ankle...?

[Judge] Very well. Mr. Wright, you \ may cross-examine the witness.

[Phoenix] (She's got to be hiding \ something... I'll press \ her until she squeals.)

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ --The Man in the Photo--

[Oldbag] (1) \ I never say anything \ I don't mean, mind you!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Umm...

[Oldbag] Whippersnapper!

[Phoenix] (Hey, I haven't said \ anything yet!)

[Oldbag] I'll have you know I'm not \ pointing fingers at anyone \ behind their backs!

[Oldbag] Everything I've said is on \ the straight and narrow! \ The up and up!

[Oldbag] Youth today! Always whining \ about each other, pointing \ fingers this way and that!

[Oldbag] It's enough to make an old \ lady want to cry...

[Edgeworth] Mr. Wright!

[Edgeworth] Please, for all our sakes, \ try not to upset the witness!

[Phoenix] (I think Edgeworth has \ met his match...)

[Oldbag] (2) \ That morning, during the \ run-through of the action \ scene...

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Who was present at \ the run-through?

[Oldbag] Well, let's see... \ There was Powers, he's \ the Steel Samurai...

[Oldbag] Then poor old Hammer, \ the Evil Magistrate.

[Oldbag] And... me.

[Judge] And what exactly were you \ doing?

[Oldbag] Observing! Just... observing.

[Phoenix] What about the assistant?

[Oldbag] Oh, she was off moving \ backdrops around and such.

[Phoenix] (So she didn't see the \ run-through, then...)

[Oldbag] (3) \ I saw Powers trip and fall!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "Trip and fall"...?

[Oldbag] Yes! And to think, he's \ supposed to be the Steel \ Samurai! What a laugh!

[Oldbag] So Powers sprained \ his ankle.

[Oldbag] I helped make it better \ for him, of course.

[Judge] You... helped make it better?

[Oldbag] I kissed it where it hurt.

[Judge] L-let's just skip over \ that part, shall we?

[Phoenix] Where was the assistant then?

[Oldbag] Oh, her? She was cleaning \ up backdrops, I think.

[Oldbag] She didn't know about \ Powers's ankle.

[Phoenix] (Hmm...)

[Edgeworth] You may continue your \ testimony.

[Oldbag] (4) \ He broke one of the props, \ it was a big mess.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] He broke a prop?

[Oldbag] Sure did! \ His own Samurai Spear.

[Phoenix] (His Samurai Spear... \ the murder weapon!?)

[Oldbag] Luckily I was there with \ my duct tape to fix it.

[Phoenix] (This strikes me as a \ significant detail...)

[] CONTINUE FOR FIRST TIME ONLY

[Phoenix] (I'd better write this \ down in the Court Record.)

[] Samurai Spear updated \ in the Court Record.

[Oldbag] (5) \ Apparently, he sprained \ his ankle pretty bad.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Was Mr. Power's ankle \ badly sprained?

[Oldbag] Not so bad that he \ couldn't walk around.

[Oldbag] He went to his dressing \ room to rest up after \ lunch.

[Phoenix] (Thus the nap...)

[Oldbag] Anyway, I saw him dragging \ his foot when he walked.

[Phoenix] (Dragging his foot... okay.)

[Oldbag] (6) \ You can see he's dragging \ his leg! See? Clear as day!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Are you absolutely sure? \ (Let's take a look at \ that picture again...)

[Phoenix] (Hmm... so he was walking \ strangely because he was \ injured...)

[Judge] Hmm. It does look like \ he was dragging his foot.

[Oldbag] See! And you didn't trust \ me! Whippersnapper!

[Oldbag] (7) \ That's how I knew it \ was Powers. Happy?

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Still, you can't look at \ this and say it's Mr. Powers!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Yes, but only Mr. Powers \ would have been dragging \ his leg!

[Judge] He has a point. It does seem \ quite likely that it was \ Powers.

[Phoenix] (There's got to be more to \ this. I'd better keep \ pressing her.)

[Maya] Well, Nick? Find any \ glaring contradictions?

[Phoenix] Well, she seems pretty \ sure that was Powers in \ that photo...

[Phoenix] I guess I'll just press \ her and see if I can \ shake her conviction...

[] ...

[] AFTER PRESSING FOR A WHILE

[Edgeworth] I think we've heard enough!

[Edgeworth] Haven't we, Your Honor?

[Judge] Well, there is one thing \ that bothers me.

[Edgeworth] Which is?

[Judge] Where is this "Steel Samurai" \ costume now?

[Edgeworth] Umm... hmm.

[Edgeworth] Actually, well... \ We couldn't find it.

[Edgeworth] We're looking, though.

[Judge] Hmm...

[Edgeworth] Anyway, that's not important!

[Edgeworth] The witness did see \ the Steel Samurai, yes.

[Edgeworth] And it is clear that the \ person in the Steel Samurai \ suit was Mr. Will Powers!

[Judge] Hmm... I suppose that's right.

[Phoenix] (Are you sure you're \ sure, Your Honor?)

***Object***********************************

[Phoenix] Hold it right there!

[Phoenix] We keep talking possibilities, \ but we have to agree that this \ photo shows the Steel Samurai!

[Phoenix] Nowhere in this photo can \ we see Mr. Will Powers!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] The defense has a point.

[Judge] I also wonder if someone else \ not caught on camera could \ have killed Mr. Hammer.

[Judge] We have to consider that \ possibility, also.

[Edgeworth] Then allow me to remove \ that doubt from your mind, \ Your Honor...

********************************************

***Wait and see what happens****************

[Phoenix] (I think I'll wait and \ see where this goes.)

[Judge] I suppose, since there weren't \ any additional crew members \ at the studios that day...

[Judge] It's quite likely that it \ was the defendant inside \ that costume.

[Judge] I see no problem with \ this evidence.

[Edgeworth] Most perceptive, Your Honor!

[Phoenix] (He still doesn't seem \ that convinced to me... \ I hope.)

********************************************

[Edgeworth] Will the witness continue \ her testimony, please?

[Oldbag] No need to ask twice!

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Witness's Account, cont.--

[Oldbag] (1) \ The time of poor Hammer's \ death was 2:30 PM, true?

[Oldbag] (2) \ The only person I saw go \ to the studio before then \ was Will Powers!

[Oldbag] (3) \ No one else went there!

[Oldbag] (4) \ If they had, I would have \ seen them!

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] So, if no one else went \ to the studio...

[Judge] Then it would have to be this \ "Steel Samurai" who did it.

[Judge] Mr. Wright, you may cross- \ examine the witness.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Witness's Account, cont.--

[Oldbag] (1) \ The time of poor Hammer's \ death was 2:30 PM, true?

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] How do you know that?

[Oldbag] Eh? Didn't I just \ explain?

[Oldbag] I gave donuts to the \ young detective.

[Oldbag] And the, after some rubbish \ about it being a "secret, pal" \ he told me everything.

[Phoenix] (I see Detective Gumshoe \ shares his fellow officer's \ fondness for donuts.)

[Oldbag] (2) \ The only person I saw go \ to the studio before then \ was Will Powers!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Are you absolutely sure!?

[Oldbag] Oh, quite, quite, sonny. \ Nobody suspicious lookin' \ passed by at all.

[Phoenix] (Nobody suspicious lookin'... \ Right.)

[Oldbag] (3) \ No one else went there!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What about before you \ got to the guard station?

[Oldbag] You mean before 1:00?

[Oldbag] Why, everyone was in the \ Employee Area before then.

[Oldbag] And I locked the main gate \ so no one could get in.

[Oldbag] Not to mention...

[Oldbag] (4) \ If they had, I would have \ seen them!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Are you sure!?

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] The witness has answered \ the question!

[Edgeworth] Anyone going into the studio \ had to pass by the witness!

[Oldbag] That's right, sonny!

[Oldbag] You let 'em have \ it, Edgey-boy!

[Phoenix] (E-Edgey-boy...?)

[Edgeworth] ...

[Maya] Old windbag sure has \ balls! Or... well, you \ know what I mean.

[Phoenix] Old windbags have a way of \ skipping over important \ details, after all...

[Phoenix] Or, for that matter, \ entirely forgetting them.

[Maya] How convenient.

[Phoenix] (Something for you to \ look forward to, perhaps?)

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Hold on!

[Phoenix] Look at this photograph \ one more time.

[Phoenix] This photo was taken by \ the camera at the gate \ for the studios, correct?

[Oldbag] Yesiree, sonny.

[Phoenix] So, whenever anyone passes \ by here, it automatically \ takes a picture?

[Oldbag] And here I thought you didn't \ know your head from a hole \ in the ground.

[Phoenix] Right... \ Anyway!

[Phoenix] It's also true that the \ computer in the guard station \ records all security cam data.

[Oldbag] Ooh! You know, if you wanted \ to work at the studio, we \ might have an opening.

[Phoenix] That very computer printed \ out this photo.

[Phoenix] Note that on the back of the \ photo are printed the words: \ [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]

[Oldbag] Even I know that means it was \ taken at 2:00 PM on October \ the 15th! Really, sonny!

[Phoenix] Actually, I knew that too.

[Phoenix] The issure here is the bit \ at the end where it says: \ "Photo #2"...

[Oldbag] "Photo #2"...?

[Phoenix] The computer only held \ data for one photo on \ that day.

[Phoenix] Don't you think that's odd?

[Phoenix] Shouldn't this photo be \ "Photo #1" if it really \ was the ONLY photo!?

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] Please tell the court what \ you mean by this, Mr. Wright!

[Phoenix] Actually, that's what I \ want to ask the witness.

[Phoenix] This evidence shows that \ not one, but two people \ went to the studio that day.

[Phoenix] Yet there is only \ data for one of the photos!

[Phoenix] Who could have erased \ the data for the other \ photo?

[Phoenix] Only someone with access... \ the security lady herself!

[Oldbag] Eh!?

[Oldbag] You watch your mouth, \ whippersnapper!

[Oldbag] The only person I saw that \ day was Will Powers!

[Phoenix] But the camera on the gate \ fired twice! That means \ two people went by!

[Oldbag] Umm... well, yes... that's \ what it would seem to mean...

[Judge] Can the witness explain \ this to the court?

[Oldbag] Umm... ahem. \ I-I don't understand these \ new-fangled computer things...

[Oldbag] Umm... E-Edgey-boy! \ Help!

[Edgeworth] Huh!?

[Edgeworth] B-believe me, I want to, \ but I don't know what \ this means either.

[Oldbag] Humph! \ Some help you are! \ You're a whippersnapper too!

[Oldbag] ...

[Oldbag] ...

[Oldbag] Whippersnapper...?

[Judge] Something the matter, \ Ms. Oldbag?

[Oldbag] Ah! \ That's right!

[Oldbag] I... \ I just remembered something!

[Judge] Let me guess...

[Judge] Someone else passed by \ the gate... someone other \ than the Steel Samurai?

[Oldbag] Er... well, yes, I suppose \ you could put it that way.

[Judge] *sigh* \ I see.

[Judge] Your testimony, please.

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ --The Other Person--

[Oldbag] (1) \ Every day, after I finish \ my guard duties, I have one \ other important job to do.

[Oldbag] (2) \ I go through the photos \ recorded on the security \ computer and check them.

[Oldbag] (3) \ I throw out any photos \ that aren't suspicious \ lookin', you see.

[Oldbag] (4) \ Come to think of it, now \ I remember throwing out \ one photo that day!

[] ...

[Edgeworth] M-Ms. Oldbag! \ This is the first I've \ heard of this!

[Oldbag] Well, of course, sonny! \ I've only just remembered it.

[Judge] Right... anyway, \ Mr. Wright, please begin \ the cross-examination.

[Maya] Well, I'd say this was a turn \ for the unexpected, but I \ kind of expected this...

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ --The Other Person--

[Oldbag] (1) \ Every day, after I finish \ my guard duties, I have one \ other important job to do.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Another "job"?

[Oldbag] T-that's right. I check all \ the people that passed by \ the main gate that day.

[Oldbag] I look closely at every one \ of the photos that security \ camera takes.

[Edgeworth] Do you backup all of the \ security camera data?

[Oldbag] Well, they keep telling \ me too, yes.

[Oldbag] But those computers are \ just so frustrating.

[Oldbag] (2) \ I go through the photos \ recorded on the security \ computer and check them.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] How many photos are there, \ usually?

[Oldbag] On a day when we're open to \ the public, we get more than \ 500 people.

[Oldbag] But on filming days \ or rehearsal days... well, \ we don't have much money.

[Oldbag] We never get mroe than \ 50, and that's a big day.

[Edgeworth] Do you backup all of the \ security camera data?

[Oldbag] Well, they keep telling \ me too, yes.

[Oldbag] But those computers are \ just so frustrating.

[Oldbag] (3) \ I throw out any photos \ that aren't suspicious \ lookin', you see.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] How exactly do you determine \ what isn't "suspicious \ lookin'"?

[Oldbag] Oh, you can tell by looking \ at their faces. For the \ most part.

[Phoenix] F-for the most part?

[Phoenix] This is a murder trial, \ Ms. Oldbag!

[Oldbag] Well, I didn't touch that \ suspicious lookin' \ Will Powers's photo, did I?

[Phoenix] (I think she's missing \ the point.)

[Oldbag] (4) \ Come to think of it, now \ I remember throwing out \ one photo that day!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Well, who in the heck was \ in that photo you erased!?

[Oldbag] Humph. \ A fanboy.

[Phoenix] F-fanboy?

[Oldbag] Steel Samurai fanboys. \ Real freaks, if you ask me.

[Oldbag] They get information about \ the rehearsals from gosh- \ knows-where.

[Oldbag] They're always hanging about. \ One was there that day.

[] END CROSS-EXAMINATION

[Maya] "Come to think of it"? \ Couldn't she think of that \ a little earlier!?

[Phoenix] Classic old windbag \ maneuver, Maya.

[Maya] Hmm...

[Maya] Might be a useful tactic \ to remember for use in my \ future career as a windbag.

[Phoenix] (Let's find out more about \ this "erased" photo.)

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] W-wait a second! \ Didn't you just say no one \ else could get in!?

[Phoenix] "I locked the main gate \ so no one could get in"... \ Those were your words!

[Oldbag] Well!

[Oldbag] If you must know, there's \ a drain that goes into the \ Employee Area.

[Oldbag] The grate has been loose \ for a while.

[Oldbag] It leads outside, and well, \ that's where they come in.

[Phoenix] They come in through \ the drain?

[Oldbag] I told you they were freaks.

[Oldbag] Oh, and...

[Phoenix] And...?

[Oldbag] They're kids. \ Children. \ Whippersnappers.

[Phoenix] K-kids!?

[Phoenix] So, on the photo that \ you erased...?

[Oldbag] It was a boy. \ Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.

[Phoenix] Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?

[Judge] O-order! Order!

[Judge] Let me get this straight.

[Judge] You saw two people pass \ by the gate on their way \ to the studios that day?

[Judge] One was the Steel Samurai, \ dragging his leg.

[Judge] The other was a boy who \ looked to be in about \ 2nd or 3rd grade?

[Oldbag] Oh yes, well we see his \ type there every day.

[Oldbag] Can't stop 'em. \ Can't catch 'em.

[Edgeworth] A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? \ Hmm...

[Edgeworth] I assume it would be hard, if \ not impossible for a young boy \ to wield the Samurai Spear?

[Judge] Impossible, I'd think. \ It's quite heavy.

[Oldbag] Right! As I said, I didn't \ pay him much mind.

[Oldbag] That's why I erased the data.

[Maya] Um, Nick? \ What's going on?

[Maya] I mean, the boy was there, \ that makes him a suspect!

[Phoenix] Yeah, and they're already \ trying to "un-suspect" him.

[Judge] I'd like to take a five minute \ recess.

[Judge] I want the defense and the \ prosecution to consider \ this new information...

[Judge] And no forgetting vital \ information this time!

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green October 18, 11:08 AM \ District Court \ Defendant Lobby No. 3

[Phoenix] Mr. WP?

[Wll] Y-yes?

[Phoenix] Tell me straight: were you \ really in your dressing room? \ You didn't go to the studio?

[Will] I-I didn't go to the studio! \ I was s-sleeping, honest.

[Maya] So who was the "Steel \ Samurai" in that security \ photo?

[Will] How should I know?

[Will] The Steel Samurai costume \ was off in the corner of \ the dressing room.

[Will] Anyone could have walked \ in and taken it, really.

[Maya] What!? \ You should take better \ care of that stuff!

[Will] I couldn't imagine anyone \ would wnat to steal a \ Steel Samurai costume!

[Will] So... where does this \ leave me?

[Phoenix] It doesn't look good...

[Will] *sniff*

[Phoenix] You're the only likely \ suspect, right now.

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] W-what are we going to do!?

[Phoenix] First, we play for more time.

[Phoenix] We'll start targeting someone \ else that could conceivably \ have done this!

[Maya] Right!

[Maya] And it'll take them so long \ to shoot us down that we \ can get another day!

[Phoenix] Right... but if we pick \ the wrong person, we \ might lose on the spot.

[Will] You... don't sound very \ optimistic.

[Phoenix] I'm not optimistic \ at all, actually.

[Maya] Hey, Nick. \ It's time.

[Phoenix] Okay. Let's go. \ *sigh*

[Will] What does that mean... \ Please don't sigh like that! \ *sniff*

[] ...

[Judge] The court will now reconvene \ for the trial of Mr. Will \ Powers.

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth, will you \ present the prosecution's \ thoughts on this matter?

[Edgeworth] The prosecution's thoughts \ are simple.

[Edgeworth] Nothing has changed.

[Edgeworth] The other person who went \ to the studios was a boy \ of roughly 10 years of age.

[Edgeworth] The photo we do have may \ not be hard evidence...

[Edgeworth] But there is still no one \ else that could have committed \ this crime!

[Edgeworth] I call for a verdict of \ "guilty" for the defendant, \ Mr. Will Powers!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Very well. Mr. Wright, \ your thoughts?

[Phoenix] The defense disagrees \ with the prosecution's \ claim.

[Phoenix] There IS another person \ who could have committed \ this crime!

[Judge] Order! \ Interesting...

[Judge] Let us hear who you have \ in mind! \ However...

[Judge] Be aware that this court \ does not look kindly on \ accusing the innocent.

[Judge] If you accuse someone who \ is obviously innocent, you \ will be penalized.

[Phoenix] (Right. Great. As if the \ stakes weren't high enough.)

[Judge] So, who was this person \ other than Mr. Powers that \ could have committed murder?

***The assistant girl***********************

[Phoenix] It was the assistant!

[Phoenix] The Steel Samurai costume \ was in his dressing room.

[Phoenix] She stole it, and in doing \ so she became the Steel \ Samurai!

[Judge] So you're saying the Steel \ Samurai in the picture is \ really the assistant?

[Phoenix] That's correct, Your Honor!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] If you're serious, you've \ got guts, Mr. Wright.

[Edgeworth] Remember the photo?

[Edgeworth] Wasn't the Steel Samurai \ a little lame!? He was \ dragging his foot!

[Phoenix] Oh. \ (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)

[Edgeworth] Remember the testimony \ concerning Powers's injury!!!

[Oldbag] Powers and poor Hammer \ were at the run-through.

[Oldbag] Oh, and me.

[Phoenix] What about the assistant?

[Oldbag] Oh, her? She was cleaning \ up backdrops, I think.

[Oldbag] She didn't know about \ Powers's ankle.

[Edgeworth] The assistant knew nothing \ of Mr. Power's injury!

[Edgeworth] She could look the Steel \ Samurai look with that \ costume...

[Edgeworth] But she couldn't walk the \ the Steel Samurai walk! \ She wouldn't have limped!

[Phoenix] Ungh!

[Maya] That kind of takes the legs \ out from under that case...

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Judge] I'm afrad I have to penalize \ you, as I warned.

[Phoenix] (Nobody knows... \ the trouble I've seen...)

[Judge] May we move on, \ Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] (Grr... this fight \ isn't over yet!)

[Phoenix] If you would, Your Honor, \ one more chance, please.

[Judge] Very well. \ Go ahead.

[Phoenix] It was the grade-school boy!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Why isn't anyone saying \ anything?

[Edgeworth] Bah!

[Edgeworth] Are you seriously suggesting \ the boy did it, Mr. Wright!?

[Edgeworth] "Grade-school boy kills \ veteran action star with \ spear!"

[Edgeworth] For one thing, it was \ the Steel Samurai holding \ the murder weapon.

[Edgeworth] Would you care to explain \ just how the boy was \ involved?

[Phoenix] (Hmm... maybe that was \ a dumb move on my part.)

[Maya] "Maybe"? \ "Maybe"!? \ How about "absolutely," Nick!

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Judge] I'm afrad I have to penalize \ you, as I warned.

***The security lady************************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] It was the security lady! \ Wendy Oldbag!

[Oldbag] W-who!?

[Phoenix] The Steel Samurai is dragging \ his leg in this picture.

[Phoenix] That means whoever was in \ the suit knew about that \ morning's injury.

[Phoenux] Maybe because... they \ had been watching the \ action scene run-through!

[Phoenix] There was only one person \ other than Powers and Hammer \ who knew about the injury.

[Phoenix] The security lady, Oldbag!

[Oldbag] W-what!? Whippersnapper!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] I-is this true, Oldbag!?

[Oldbag] Oldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag \ to you!

[Phoenix] Ms. Oldbag was standing guard \ alone at the main gate.

[Phoenix] She was by herself... in other \ words, she has no alibi!

[Phoenix] She could have briefly left \ her post to steal the \ the Steel Samurai costume...

[Phoenix] Then slipped into Studio One, \ the scene of the murder!

[Judge] W-why would she go through \ the trouble of wearing \ the Steel Samurai costume!?

[Phoenix] Simple, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] She knew the camera at the \ gate would take her picture.

[Phoenix] If she was in his costume, \ she could point the finger \ at Mr. Powers!

[Judge] I see!

[Judge] Excellent deductive \ reasoning, Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] (Ohhh yeah, right here! \ Sherlock Holmes II, baby!)

[Phoenix] ...?

[Phoenix] (That's odd.)

[Phoenix] (Isn't this the part where \ Edgeworth pounces...?)

[Phoenix] (Doesn't he usually jump up \ with an objection and some \ new damning evidence...?)

[Judge] Well, Mr. Edgeworth? \ Does the prosecution have an \ opinion on this matter?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] The prosecution has no \ meaningful objections \ at this time.

[Oldbag] W-w-what!? \ What's that supposed to mean!?

[Oldbag] Oh, so you all think \ I did it? Is that it!?

[Oldbag] Edgey-boy! Don't just sit \ there, do something!

[Phoenix] (Funny, I feel bad for \ her all of a sudden.)

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] It's true that the witness \ could conceivably have \ committed this crime.

[Judge] Yet we must not forget that \ the victim was an action hero.

[Judge] As formidable as her \ personality may be, I doubt \ she'd be strong enough.

[Poenix] (Uh oh! If he removes her \ from consideration, that \ means Mr. Powers is it!)

[Phoenix] (Sorry, windbag... \ but I don't have a choice.)

********************************************

[Phoenix] The very same reasoning that \ makes Mr. Powers a suspect \ in this case...

[Phoenix] can be used to cast doubt \ on Ms. Oldbag's actions on \ that day!

[Oldbag] B-but why would I do something \ so horrible to poor Hammer!?

[Phoenix] You forget that Mr. Powers \ lacks a clear motive, too.

[Judge] Hmm... \ Indeed.

[Phoenix] (That did it. Now windbag \ is one of the suspects.)

[Phoenix] (No hard feelings... \ I hope.)

[Oldbag] Wait just a minute!

[Oldbag] What about the other person \ who went to the studio!?

[Oldbag] The boy! The one whose \ photo I erased!

[Judge] He's only a grade schooler \ though, as you said. \ 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?

[Oldbag] Th-that doesn't matter!

[Oldbag] When I was that age, I could \ pin my old man in 10 seconds, \ tops!

[Judge] Hmm... \ Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] That boy is not the killer.

[Oldbag] What!? \ How can you be so sure!

[Oldbag] Oh, or is it be nice to the \ kids and mean to your elders \ day? Whippersnapper!

[Phoenix] I have proof.

[Oldbag] P-proof!?

[Judge] Indeed? Then let's \ see this proof, Mr. Wright.

[Judge] You have proof that shows \ the boy could not have \ committed this murder?

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] This is my proof!

[Judge] ...

[Judge] I can't see how that has \ anything to do with this \ matter, Mr. Wright?

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Judge] There aren't that many \ pieces of evidence in \ the Court Record.

[Judge] Please try not to pick \ the wrong ones!

[Phoenix] S-sorry, Your Honor.

[Judge] I'll ask again, Mr. Wright.

[] RETURN TO COURT RECORD

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] The murder weapon was \ the Samurai Spear.

[Phoenix] That very spear is shown \ here in this photo.

[Judge] I see!

[Judge] Well, would the witness \ care to comment on this?

[Oldbag] Mrph.

[Phoenix] (The windbag... speechless. \ This has got to be a first.)

[Judge] Very well!

[Judge] This court will suspend \ proceedings on the current \ trial for today.

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth, please find out \ more about your witness, Ms. \ Windy... what was her name?

[Maya] Sorry, I don't know how \ that will help us figure \ this out.

********************************************

***Talk about "What to do"******************

[Phoenix] What do you think \ we should do?

[Maya] W-what do I... huh!? \ Why don't we do what you \ just said!?

[Maya] We gotta get the scoop \ on this director and \ producer.

[Phoenix] Oh, right. Then there's \ no point hanging out here.

[Maya] That's what I've been \ saying! Let's get to \ those studios pronto!

********************************************

***Talk about "Any ideas"*******************

[Maya] Hmm.

[Maya] We don't have enough \ information to make \ a case yet.

[Phoenix] That's exactly the \ same thing you said \ yesterday!

[Phoenix] Just admit it: you don't \ have a clue what happened.

[Maya] There's not enough \ information!

[Will] Oh, Mr. Wright! \ Thank you for earlier.

[Phoenix] Not at all. We got lucky, \ to tell the truth.

[Maya] You can say that again!

[Phoenix] Let's not.

[Maya] So, WP!

[Maya] Do you have any leads \ that might get us going \ in the right direction?

[Will] Hmm...

[Will] S-sorry, but no.

[Maya] Be sure to tell us anything \ that comes to mind, no matter \ how small.

[Phoenix] We can't rely on getting \ lucky again tomorrow.

[Will] Y-yes... *sniff*

[Phoenix] This guard monitors \ the visitor's room.

***Present Cardkey**************************

[Phoenix] We found this cardkey \ in your dressing room.

[Will] Oh, that's mine, yes.

[Maya] Can people outside the \ studios get these cards?

[Will] I don't think so.

[Will] Even I have to return \ the card.

[Will] Once the show's done \ filming, that is.

[Maya] Huh...

********************************************

***Present Powers's(?) Photo****************

[Phoenix] Regarding this photograph...

[Will] Y-yes...?

[Phoenix] This really, truly, absolutely \ isn't you, right?

[Will] R-right. *sniff*

[Will] I was sleeping in my \ dressing room the \ whole time, honest.

[Phoenix] But who else could \ have worn it!?

[Maya] Your costume was in \ your dressing room?

[Will] Yes.

[Will] I guess they snuck in and \ took it while I was asleep.

[Phoenix] (But who!?)

********************************************

***Present Samurai Spear********************

[Phoenix] Regarding the murder weapon...

[Will] Yes?

[Phoenix] Is it heavy, that spear?

[Will] It's pretty hefty, yeah.

[Will] I don't think the average \ person would be able to \ swing it around effectively.

[Phoenix] Hmm...

[Maya] And... that's the spear that \ broke or something during \ the morning run-through?

[Will] Oh yes, I goofed on a round \ kick, you see...

[Will] I broke the spear.

[Will] The security lady fixed \ it for me right away though.

[Maya] With duct tape. We heard.

********************************************

***Present other****************************

[Will] E-excuse me.

[Will] Thank you for showing \ me that, whatever it is.

[Will] I wish I could think of some \ way I could help you...

[Will] S-sorry. *sniff*

********************************************

***Talk about "The fanboy"******************

[Phoenix] Do, er, "fanboys" sneak \ into the studios often?

[Will] No, not that I know of.

[Will] That security lady's \ pretty strict with them.

[Maya] But, in today's testimony, \ didn't she say they were \ often hanging around?

[Will] The kids really, really \ love the Steel Samurai.

[Will] They sneak past when she's \ not looking, I guess.

********************************************

***Talk about "The director"****************

[Phoenix] Was the director present \ at the morning run-through?

[Will] Y-yes, yes he was.

[Will] He was directing how the \ Steel Samurai and the Evil \ Magistrate should move.

[Maya] Why didn't you tell \ us that before!?

[Will] W-well, just, the studio \ asked us to keep quiet...

[Maya] That has nothing to \ do with this!

[Maya] I hate to repeat myself, \ but Nick here is a newbie \ lawyer! Fresh off the bar!

[Maya] When he loses, he's \ going to lose big!

[Will] I... I see. *sniff*

[Phoenix] (Whose side is she on!?)

[Maya] You aren't hiding anything \ else from us, are you!?

[Will] N-no, I sure hope not.

[Phoenix] You're right.

[Phoenix] He's probably up to his neck \ in paperwork after the \ commotion at today's trial.

[Maya] So, Nick...

[Maya] Remember that "Studio Two" \ we heard about at the trial \ today?

[Maya] It was down that path \ with the fallen tree, right?

[Phoenix] Yeah, I think that's \ what they said.

[Maya] Maybe the director and \ the rest of them are \ there today?

[Maya] Now's our chance, Nick! \ Let's check it out!

[] ...

***Examine bench****************************

[Phoenix] I'm bushed. \ Maybe I'll sit down here \ for a bit.

[Maya] This is exactly why I don't \ want to get old, ever.

[Phoenix] H-hey! I'm still young! \ I'm just tired!

[Maya] Nick, when you start having \ to say "I'm still young," \ you know it's all over.

[Phoenix] (But... but I AM still young!)

********************************************

***Examine camera***************************

[Phoenix] That's the security camera \ that automatically takes \ pictures of people here.

[Phoenix] It took two pictures on the \ day of the murder, before \ the actual time of death.

[Phoenix] One of them was the Steel \ Samurai. The other was \ a grade school boy.

[Phoenix] It doesn't seem to be switched \ on today.

********************************************

[Maya] It says "Welcome."

[Phoenix] They let people in here \ when they're not filming, \ right?

[Maya] Nick! Let's come here \ some day! Whaddya say?

[Phoenix] Sure, if that security lady \ lets us in.

********************************************

***Examine mascot***************************

[Phoenix] The studio mascot.

[Phoenix] Apparently it's a monkey \ of some kind.

[Phoenix] I've never seen a monkey \ with a nose like that before!

[Maya] Why don't they \ put his head back on?

[Maya] Maybe we should ask \ that assistant?

[Phoenix] I'm not sure we really \ want her fixing anything.

[Phoenix] And you'd probably need \ a crane to move that thing.

[Maya] Probably so.

********************************************

***Examine path to the left*****************

[Phoenix] In the trial, they said \ Studio Two was down this path.

[Phoenix] The monkey head is in the way, \ but we should be able to \ get by it without a problem.

[Maya] This monkey head \ is real heavy!

[Phoenix] Well, it did knock that tree \ over when it fell.

[Maya] Both of these, the monkey head \ and the tree, fell the day \ of the murder, didn't they.

[Phoenix] Yeah, that's what Detective \ Gumshoe said.

********************************************

***Examine backdrop*************************

[Phoenix] Looks like a backdrop \ for a stage.

[Phoenix] This must be used in \ the Steel Samurai show.

[Maya] Of course! That's the \ mountain, Neo Fujiyama!

[Phoenix] Doesn't the Steel Samurai take \ place in Olde Tokyo? Can you \ even see Mt. Fuji from there?

[Maya] Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! \ "Neo" Olde Tokyo!

********************************************

***Examine white board**********************

[Pheonix] That's for reflecting light. \ They call it a reflecting \ screen or something like that.

[Maya] Huh.

[Phoenix] What? Where's your \ enthusiasm for all \ things entertainment?

[Maya] Well, lighting is fine, but \ I'd want to be the director. \ Or maybe the Steel Samurai!

[Maya] It doesn't really look \ much like a "studio," \ does it?

[Phoenix] No, that it does not.

[Maya] Hey... \ There's a trailer over there.

[Phoenix] It looks pretty sturdy \ for a movie set trailer.

[Maya] Are we sure this is \ a studio?

[] ...

***Examine van******************************

[Phoenix] A light van for moving \ staff and equipment around.

[Phoenix] They've kept it in pretty \ good shape. Looks like it'd \ run fine.

[Maya] Well, let's go for a drive!

[Phoenix] Sure... if I had a license.

[Maya] Nick! You don't have \ a driver's license!?

[Phoenix] But, look, I have this!

[Maya] Why are you showing me \ your attorney's badge, Nick?

********************************************

***Examine incinerator**********************

[Phoenix] An incinerator. Apparently \ they just put this one in.

[Phoenix] It's already covered in soot. \ They must not clean it much.

********************************************

***Examine "2"******************************

[Phoenix] There's a big "2" painted \ here.

[Maya] Probably because this \ is Studio Two?

[Phoenix] Probably... \ Though it doesn't look \ anything like a studio.

********************************************

***Examine table****************************

[Phoenix] Looks like two people \ ate here.

[Phoenix] There's nothing left \ on the plates.

[Maya] Hey, so they ate t-bone \ steaks too.

[Phoenix] What is it with \ steaks around here?

[Maya] Hey! There's always room \ for steak!

[Maya] But... something does \ seem out of place...

[Phoenix] What?

[Maya] I... don't know. It just \ feels "odd."

********************************************

***Examine storage materials****************

[Phoenix] These look like materials \ for making a movie set.

[Maya] They've been sitting here \ for quite some time.

[Maya] This might as well \ be a junkyard.

********************************************

[Phoenix] There're some flowers here.

[Maya] Wow, so pretty! \ They're taking good care \ of these.

[Phoenix] Don't get to close. That \ fence looks dangerous.

[Phoenix] Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!

[Penny] Actually, she just \ called me.

[Penny] She told me to cover \ up that drain...

[Phoenix] You mean that one?

[Phoenix] (Wow, what a mess...)

[Penny] I... I know...

[Penny] I'm not so good with \ handiwork. Some \ assistant, right?

[Maya] Yeah, but you do work on \ the props, and the back- \ drops, right?

[Penny] R-right.

[Penny] Just... lots of times they \ end up looking worse than \ they did before I fixed them.

[Phoenix] The door to the dressing room. \ It's not locked.

[Maya] He came in through \ that drain?

[Phoenix] So it seems. \ I guess they covered \ it up in a hurry.

[Maya] Hey... \ Hey, Nick!

[Maya] If that drain's covered, \ the boy won't be able to \ get in.

[Phoenix] Uh, yeah. I think that \ was the idea...?

[Maya] I feel kinda sorry \ for him, though. \ Don't you?

[Phoenix] What, you want to \ rip the grate off?

[Maya] Really, Nick? \ We can!?

[Phoenix] (Whoa... she's serious? \ Uh oh...)

[Phoenix] Some tea and cookies...

[Maya] Wait... Nick!

[Maya] *grumble* \ (They're snacks! They're \ meant to be eaten!)

********************************************

***Examine costumes*************************

[Phoenix] There's some regular suits \ in among the costumes here.

[Phoenix] Those must be Mr. Powers's \ personal clothes.

********************************************

***Examine cosmetics************************

[Phoenix] There's an array of \ cosmetics here.

[Phoenix] According to Maya, that \ wig was used in some old \ TV show...

[Maya] "Samurai Boogey-Woogey," \ Nick! Get with the picture!

[Penny] You mean the Samurai Spear?

[Penny] Yeah, it's a prop, but it's \ still pretty heavy.

[Penny] I hate having to carry \ that thing around.

[Maya] Do kids sneak in \ here a lot?

[Penny] Well...

[Penny] I don't think there's that \ many of them, but I do see \ one in particular a bunch.

[Penny] He's always gawking at the \ sets, of snapping pictures.

[Penny] You should see Old Windbag's \ eyes flash when she sees him.

[Penny] She has a bit of trouble \ catching him though...

********************************************

***Talk about "The director, et al."********

[Phoenix] I heard something at \ the trial today.

[Phoenix] They said that the director \ and producer were here the \ day of the murder...

[Penny] Oh, sorry...

[Penny] I was in the prop storage \ room, so I didn't see them.

[Penny] I guess they were \ here, though.

[Penny] The studio head seemed pretty \ eager to keep us quiet.

[Maya] So they were trying \ to protect the director?

[Penny] More the producer, really.

[Penny] The producer's our real \ star here.

[Penny] She saved these studios from \ the brink of disaster and \ kept them running.

[Phoenix] Probably... \ Though it doesn't look \ anything like a studio.

[Phoenix] These look like materials \ for making a movie set.

[Phoenix] They've been sitting here \ for quite some time.

[Phoenix] This might as well \ be a junkyard.

***Examine flowers**************************

[Phoenix] Nameless flowers bloom \ in solitude.

[Phoenix] They probably have a proper \ name...

[Phoenix] But it is not for me to know. \ Not now, nor ever till the \ end of my days.

[Phoenix] I need a vacation.

***Examine middle poster********************

[Phoenix] "'Samurai Summer' \ starring Jack Hammer."

[Phoenix] This poster looks like it's \ been hanging here for years.

[Mia] This is one of Maya's \ favorite movies.

[Phoenix] Maybe we should replace \ the poster in the office \ with this one?

[Mia] That... would be \ kind of sad.

********************************************

***Examine left poster**********************

[Phoenix] Another old movie poster. \ "'The Singing Samurai' \ starring Jack Hammer."

[Phoenix] What the hell do samurai \ sing about? Chopping off \ heads?

[Mia] It's a samurai musical \ set in ancient Japan.

[Phoenix] A s-samurai musical? \ Is that even a genre!?

[Phoenix] Well, I'm impressed. \ You know your stuff, Mia.

[Mia] Oh, Maya's the real fan. \ I just picked a little up.

[Phoenix] I was expecting some cool \ theme snacks, or something. \ Popcorn, at least!

[Mia] Look at this! "Spaghetti \ in a Soda Can"...?

[Phoenix] S-spaghetti?

[Phoenix] Wouldn't just the sauce \ come out and the noodles \ all stay stuck inside?

[Cody] Man, for a grown-up, \ you sure are dumb!

[Phoenix] I'll give you this... \ IF you help me.

[Cody] But that's my card! \ By offering me something I \ already own, you're in effect

[Cody] eschewing the very basis of \ our consumer society, namely \ the principle of fair trade!

[Cody] Man, for a grown-up, \ you sure are dumb!

[Phoenix] (W-what do they teach these \ kids in school these days!? \ Quantum physics!?)

[Cody] Whatever, I don't need \ that card.

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Cody] I got a double.

[Cody] Just keep it. \ It's yours.

[Phoenix] (What!? After I went through \ all that trouble...)

[Cody] If you want to trade, \ find me a REALLY rare \ card!

[Phoenix] "Really rare"!? \ You mean there's something \ rarer than "Ultra Rare"!?

[Cody] Ultra Rare Premium cards \ are way rarer than plain \ Ultra Rare cards! Come ON!

[Phoenix] H-hey, watch that attitude!

[Mia] Phoenix, you really \ should't yell like that. \ He's only a kid.

[Cody] Yeah! Don't yell like that \ I'm only a kid!

[Penny] Nope.

[Penny] You missed it, though.

[Penny] Of course, he got away in \ the end. Boy, was she mad!

[Mia] Isn't that the Steel Samurai's \ motto? "For great justice"?

[Mia] You have to help us fight \ for great justice, too.

[Cody] I... \ I saw...

[Cody] I saw everything!

[Phoenix] (Well, well... \ We might get some useful \ information out of him yet.)

********************************************

***Talk about "What you saw"****************

[Phoenix] Cody... I need to ask \ you something very \ important.

[Phoenix] What did you see on the \ day of the incident?

[Cody] ...

[Cody] I got here that day \ around 2:00...

[Cody] I had to come in through \ the woods out back so that \ old lady wouldn't see me.

[Cody] I got kinda lost, though. \ I was in there for maybe \ a half hour or so.

[Cody] Then I finally got \ to the studio.

[Cody] After that...

[Mia] What is it, Cody?

[Cody] Th-the Steel Samurai killed \ the bad guy!

[Cody] He used his Samurai Spear! \ Just like always! One shot, \ one kill!

[Cody] It happened so fast... \ I got scared.

[Cody] I went home after that.

[Phoenix] I... I see. \ It must have been hard \ for you.

[Cody] Man, you say those nice things \ but it's so obvious you aren't \ speaking from the heart.

[Phoenix] (Umm... right.) \ Mia?

[Mia] Yes?

[Phoenix] I think we can say for sure \ this means the Steel Samurai \ did it.

[Mia] True enough.

[Phoenix] And the director has an \ alibi, so it wasn't him.

[Mia] Indeed.

[Phoenix] So... the only person left \ who it could have been is \ Will Powers!

[Mia] ...

[Mia] I have to admit, it's kind \ of a shock.

[Mia] But if you put this boy on \ the witness stand, your client \ will be "guilty" for sure.

[Phoenix] Let's not call him then...

[Mia] I think that would be wise. \ Best to leave this one alone.

[???] Not so fast, pal!

[Gumshoe] I heard everything!

[Gumshoe] This boy here's \ a key witness!

[Gumshoe] And he's under police \ protection, starting now!

[Gumshoe] C'mon, son.

[Gumshoe] You've got a rendezvous \ with me down at the precinct!

[Cody] No! I ain't going!

[Cody] Waah!

[Mia] ...

[Mia] That didn't go so well.

[Mia] We're back to zero leads.

[Mia] And now we have a serious \ handicap in court.

[Phoenix] W-what're we going to do, Mia!

[Mia] Well, hmm...

[Mia] I... really need to be going.

[Mia] Don't worry, Phoenix. \ I'm sure you'll be fine!

[Phoenix] Whoa whoa whoa!

[Phoenix] C-come to the trial \ tomorrow, please! \ I need you there!

[Mia] Phoenix, can I ask you \ something?

[Mia] Do you really believe \ that Mr. Powers is innocent?

***I believe********************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * Of course he is!

[Mia] Phoenix.

[Mia] Your client is now practically \ a dead man walking...

[Phoenix] This is no time for dead- \ people jokes, please.

[Mia] You know we're going into this \ trial utterly defenseless.

[Mia] Yet, if Mr. Powers is \ truly innocent...

[Phoenix] The defense is ready, \ Your Honor.

[Judge] Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your \ opening statement, please.

[Edgeworth] An unexpected fact has come \ to the attention of the court.

[Edgeworth] Yesterday, we learned that \ there were other people \ present at the studios!

[Edgeworth] Today, I would like to show \ evidence proving they had \ nothing to do with the murder.

[Judge] Very well.

[Judge] You may call your first \ witness, Mr. Edgeworth.

[Phoenix] (I wonder if that producer \ is going to come out...)

[Edgeworth] The prosecution calls \ Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.

[Phoenix] (... or that director.)

[] ...

[Edgeworth] Will the witness state \ his name and profession?

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Very well. Please testify \ to the court about the \ events of that day.

[Mia] Phoenix.

[Mia] Let's start by picking this \ testimony apart.

[Mia] If Powers is innocent, \ you know what that means.

[Mia] Someone in the trailer \ on that day did it!

[Phoenix] R-right. \ (She doesn't waste any time \ putting on the pressure!)

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- The Day of the Murder --

[Manella] (1) \ I was at the studios from \ around 9:00 that morning.

[Manella] (2) \ During the morning, I was \ doing... umm... an action \ scene run-through.

[Manella] (3) \ It took a lot more time \ than I thought it would.

[Manella] (4) \ I hear that everyone else \ ate lunch in the Employee \ Area...

[Manella] (5) \ But I had a meeting in the \ Studio Two trailer, so I ended \ up skipping lunch.

[Manella] (6) \ We were in the meeting \ until around 4:00...

[Manella] (7) \ During the meeting, well, \ I'm pretty sure no one \ left their chairs.

[Manella] That's about it.

[] -------------------------------------------...

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] The time of Mr. Hammer's \ death was 2:30 PM.

[Judge] And according to your \ testimony, you were in \ a meeting at that time.

[Judge] Mr. Wright, you may begin \ your cross-examination.

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- The Day of the Murder --

[Manella] (1) \ I was at the studios from \ around 9:00 that morning.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Is that when you always \ come in to work?

[Manella] Oh, oh no. I come in all \ sort of hours. It's the \ "industry" way.

[Phoenix] (Yeah, I know all about \ the freaks in your \ "industry"...)

[Manella] Still, FWIW, I was pretty \ busy all that day. :(

[Edgeworth] Tell us more about that.

[Manella] (2) \ During the morning, I was \ doing... umm... an action \ scene run-through.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] In the Employee Area?

[Manella] That's right.

[Manella] It was a fight scene between \ the Steel Samurai and the \ Evil Magistrate.

[Phoenix] Was anyone else at \ the run-through?

[Manella] Oh, yeah. That security lady \ was sitting there watching \ the whole thing. LOL.

[Manella] She was cheering on Hammer, \ if you can believe it.

[Phoenix] (She certainly has the \ lungs for it...)

[Phoenix] Anyone else?

[Manella] Nope, just us four.

[Manella] (3) \ It took a lot more time \ than I thought it would.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Why did it go on so long?

[Manella] Um, I'm pretty sure j00've \ already heard about this...

[Manella] But WP twisted his ankle \ during the run-through, see...

[Phoenix] (Oh, right, thus the limp.)

[Manella] Which of course lef to me \ missing my lunch. ROFS!

[Phoenix] (ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... \ Starving?)

[Manella] (4) \ I hear that everyone else \ ate lunch in the Employee \ Area...

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What exactly did they \ have for lunch?

[Manella] T-bone steak! \ The assistant cooked some up.

[Phoenix] (Come to think of it, there \ was a plate with some bones \ on it in the Employee Area.)

[Edgeworth] "Everyone else" meaning \ that the witness did not \ eat with them.

[Manella] (5) \ But I had a meeting in the \ Studio Two trailer, so I ended \ up skipping lunch.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So, in the end, you didn't \ get to eat?

[Manella] Yeah. No steak, at least! \ Can j00 believe it?

[Phoenix] That must have been tough.

[Mia] Phoenix.

[Phoenix] Yeah?

[Mia] Doesn't something about \ that seem odd to you?

***Not at all*******************************

[Phoenix] Well, no, not really. \ Seems pretty straightforward.

[Mia] Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.

********************************************

***It's a little vague**********************

[Phoenix] Actually, there is something \ bothering me.

[Phoenix] Mr. Manella, just now you \ said "steak, at least."

[Phoenix] So you ate something \ other than steak?

[Manella] Yeah, good call!

[Manella] I had some chocolate in \ my pocket, which I used to \ stave off starvation!

[Phoenix] I see...

[Phoenix] (Is that all? I was sure \ I was on to something there.)

********************************************

***It's contradictory***********************

[Phoenix] Yeah, it does seem odd, \ now that you mention it.

[Phoenix] Mr. Manella!

[Manella] H-hmm? \ W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*

[Phoenix] When I went to that trailer, \ I saw something on the table.

[Phoenix] There were two plates on the \ table--the same kind of plates \ as in the Employee Area.

[Phoenix] Who ate lunch there?

[Manella] M-mmpf!

[Manella] No, er, ah, um, eh \ heh. Good call! *sweats*

[Manella] I, er, I was embarrassed so \ I didn't mention it...

[Manella] But I did eat, after all.

[Phoenix] A t-bone steak, you mean?

[Manella] Yeah, well, I mean the \ assistant went through \ all that trouble...

[Manella] I brought it to the trailer \ thinking I could eat it later.

[Phoenix] (Clearly a man who likes \ to eat. I'd suspected \ as much...)

[Phoenix] So, when exactly did \ you eat it?

[Manella] We took one break during \ that meeting.

[Manella] I, er, wolfed it down then. \ *drool*

[Phoenix] (A mental image I will carry \ with me to my grave...)

[Phoenix] (Wait a second...!)

[Phoenix] (If they took a break in that \ meeting, that contradicts \ his testimony!)

[Phoenix] (I'll press on that one \ a bit more...)

[Manella] The Steel Samurai story, \ and our budget.

[Manella] Get this! The sponsors turn \ to me and say, "Mr. Manella."

[Manella] "Those scripts of yours are \ not appropriate for children." \ Can j00 believe it!?

[Phoenix] (Actually, I kind of can.)

[Phoenix] So, nobody left the table \ during the whole meeting?

[Manella] (7) \ During the meeting, well, \ I'm pretty sure no one \ left their chairs.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] You didn't take a single \ break?

[Manella] Er... well...

[Manella] Y-yeah! \ Not a one! *sweats*

[Manella] Oops! ROFL!

[Phoenix] Well?

[Manella] Umm...

[Judge] Mr. Manella, what's this \ all about?

[Manella] W-well, yeah, I guess \ we did take a little break.

[Mia] Phoenix! \ Great job!

[Mia] If they took a break, one \ of them could have gone to \ the studio during that time!

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] I call on the witness to \ testify to the court about \ this break!

[Judge] Very well.

[Judge] Mr. Manella, your \ testimony, please.

[Manella] Urk!

[Edgeworth] Heh heh heh...

[Phoenix] (Uh oh. Edgeworth is \ laughing...)

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- The Break --

[Manella] (1) \ Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... \ ROFL!

[Manella] (2) \ But it was only 15 minutes! \ 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!

[Manella] (3) \ Not enough time for someone \ to, say, commit murder in \ Studio One! LOL!

[Manella] (4) \ That's only just enough time \ to eat a t-bone steak, if \ you ask me! *steams*

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] I don't think it would even \ be enough time for that, \ but that's just me.

[Judge] Very well. You may begin \ the cross-examination.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- The Break --

[Manella] (1) \ Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... \ ROFL!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What time exactly did you \ take this break?

[Manella] Hmm...

[Manella] I'd say it was from around \ 2:30 or so untl 2:45.

[Phoenix] (2:30!!!)

[Phoenix] (That's the time of death!)

[Phoenix] (So he could have gone to \ Studio One, killed Hammer, \ and come back...)

[Phoenix] (I guess it's possible, \ time-wise...)

[Edgeworth] ...

[Manella] (2) \ But it was only 15 minutes! \ 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What were you doing for \ those 15 minutes?

[Manella] Eating my t-bone steak! \ What else!?

[Phoenix] There were two plates on \ the trailer table...?

[Manella] Oh, right. The other one \ was Diva's... sorry, Dee \ Vasquez's plate.

[Phoenix] (Dee Vasquez... the producer.)

[Edgeworth] To eat a t-bone steak in \ 15 minutes... that's quite \ a feat.

[Manella] (3) \ Not enough time for someone \ to, say, commit murder in \ Studio One! LOL!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Why is that?

[] END CROSS-EXAMINATION

[Manella] (4) \ That's only just enough time \ to eat a t-bone steak, if \ you ask me! *steams*

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] I have to say, you look like \ a guy who gets through his \ meals pretty fast.

[Manella] Well, I was facing a cold, \ slightly chewy t-bone steak...

[Manella] Even I have to take my time \ eating that kind of food. LOL

[Mia] Well, Phoenix?

[Phoenix] That testimony was too short \ to wring any kind of useful \ information out of!

[Mia] All you have to do is prove \ that he was able to go to \ Studio One in that time!

[Phoenix] (Oh, great. Is that all...)

[] ...

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Haven't we had enough of this \ pointless line of questioning?

[Edgeworth] Your Honor!

[Edgeworth] The testimony to this point \ has made one certain fact \ painfully clear:

[Edgeworth] The people in the trailer \ had nothing to do with this \ murder!

[Edgeworth] It was impossible for any \ of them to go to Studio One!

[Phoenix] What!?

[Edgeworth] Something wrong, Mr. Wright?

[Edgeworth] Surely you aren't suggesting \ one of the people in the \ trailer went to Studio One!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Well, Mr. Wright?

[Mia] Phoenix, this is critical!

[Mia] Think about it before \ you give your answer!

[Judge] Do you claim someone from the \ trailer went to Studio One?

***I claim it, and claim it loud************

[Phoenix] (If I agree to let everyone \ in that trailer off the hook \ then the trial is over...)

[Phoenix] (Mr. Powers will be \ found guilty for sure!)

[Phoenix] The victim was murdered \ at 2:30, the exact time \ of the break in the meeting.

[Phoenix] With 15 minutes, murder \ is certainly a possibility!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] I suppose you might \ say that...

[Phoenix] (Alright, I've got the judge \ thinking now!)

[Edgeworth] Tsk, tsk, tsk...

[Edgeworth] Never a dull moment with \ you, Mr. Wright!

[Phoenix] What's your point, Edgeworth!

[Edgeworth] You've been doing your \ homework, haven't you?

[Edgeworth] Look at the Court Record.

[Phoenix] The Court Record...?

[Edgeworth] Surely, you knew that from \ 2:15 to 4:00 the path between \ the studios was blocked?

[Edgeworth] Mrs. Monkey's head had \ fallen across the path!

[Phoenix] Whoa! You're right!

[Edgeworth] True, the break in the trailer \ meeting came right at the \ time of death...

[Edgeworth] However!

[Edgeworth] The path from there to \ the scene of the crime \ was blocked!

[Edgeworth] The fallen Mrs. Monkey head \ barred the way!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," \ but Edgeworth has a point...)

[Phoenix] (And somehow, I feel no \ desire to correct him.)

[Judge] No counter-argument, \ Mr. Wright?

[Judge] Then I'm afraid you lose \ this round.

********************************************

***No, it's impossible**********************

[Phoenix] (I don't want to write off \ so many possible suspects...)

[Phoenix] (But I can't keep claiming \ the impossible, either...)

[Phoenix] I agree that it was impossible \ for anyone in the trailer to \ go to the studio in that time.

[Edgeworth] Ha hah!

[Edgeworth] I thought you might be \ thoughtlessly treading on \ thin ice again!

[Edgeworth] But I see you had at least \ an inkling of the truth.

[Judge] What do you mean, \ Mr. Edgeworth?

[Edgeworth] It's quite simple...

[Edgeworth] True, the break in the trailer \ meeting came right at the \ time of death...

[Edgeworth] However!

[Edgeworth] The path from there to \ the scene of the crime \ was blocked!

[Edgeworth] The fallen Mrs. Monkey head \ barred the way!

[Edgeworth] At around 2:15, a strong \ gust of wind knocked off \ the studio mascot's head.

[Edgeworth] Ergo!

[Edgeworth] When the people in the trailer \ took a break at 2:30, the \ way to the studio was blocked.

[Edgeworth] Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's \ severed head!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," \ but Edgeworth has a point...)

[Phoenix] (And somehow, I feel no \ desire to correct him.)

********************************************

[Edgeworth] I believe we have seen \ enough evidence.

[Edgeworth] I would like to relieve \ Mr. Manella from the stand.

[Phoenix] (Wh-what? It's over?)

[Judge] Very well. \ The court's opinion on this \ case is as follows:

[Judge] We have found that there were \ several other people in Studio \ 2 on the day of the murder.

[Judge] However, it is also clear that \ none of these people could \ have gone to Studio One.

[Judge] They therefore have no \ relation to this case.

[Jduge] Furthermore, with regards \ to the photo of the Steel \ Samurai...

[Judge] Given the size of the costume, \ no one other than Mr. Powers \ could have worn it that day.

[Judge] All that is lacking is \ decisive evidence that \ he is the one who did it.

[Judge] If we had that, I'm afraid \ I would have to find Mr. \ Powers guilty.

[Edgeworth] Your Honor.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution is pleased to \ announce that we indeed have \ decisive evidence: a witness.

[Judge] Who is this witness, \ Mr. Edgeworth?

[Edgeworth] My witness saw the very \ moment when the Steel Samurai \ skewered the victim!

[Judge] Order! I will have order!

[Judge] I see.

[Judge] The court will take a 10 \ minute recess, after which we \ will hear your witness.

[Judge] Court is adjourned for \ recess!

[Phoenix] Don't tell me you're giving \ up! If you give up, what \ hope do I have...?

[Mia] Don't get me wrong.

[Mia] I've never given up on a trial \ before, not while there was \ a chance.

[Mia] But I was wrong.

[Mia] That's all there is.

[Will] Er... \ What's going to happen to me?

[Judge] Court is back in session for \ the trial of Mr. Will Powers.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution has a concern.

[Edgeworth] As our witness is a grade \ schooler of tender years, \ and this is a murder case...

[Edgeworth] We worry that the defense \ might cause unnecessary trauma \ with his cruel questioning!

[Phoenix] (Nice to see Edgeworth taking \ the moral high ground...)

[Edgeworth] However, we have no choice.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution calls \ Cody Hackins to the stand.

[] ...

[Edgeworth] Your Honor. \ Perhaps you could arrange \ a box for him to stand on?

[Judge] Oh, r-right.

[Judge] Guard, please bring him a box. \ One of those donut crates \ should do.

[] ...

[Edgeworth] Will the witness state his \ name and grade in school.

[Cody] ...

[Edgeworth] Witness!

[Cody] What!? Just 'cause you're all \ grown-up don't mean you can \ push me around!

[Edgeworth] Mrph...

[Mia] Cody?

[Mia] Answer his question, okay?

[Cody] H-hey, it's you! \ The nice lady!

[Cody] I'm Cody Hackins. \ I'm in 2nd grade!

[Phoenx] (I get the feeling this is \ going to be a long, long \ day...)

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth.

[Judge] Please remember that you're \ speaking to a child. Try to \ be gentle.

[Edgeworth] M-mrrrrph!

[Edgeworth] Witness! Er, I mean, \ Cody.

[Phoenix] (He's having trouble with \ this "gentle" thing.)

[Edgeworth] You were present, er, you \ were at Global Studios on the \ day of the, er, incident?

[Cody] You got a problem with that!?

[Edgeworth] Please tell us what you \ saw that day.

[Cody] What, pops? You want me to \ tell you and gramps with \ the beard over there?

[Edgeworth] Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will \ be fine.

[Judge] I prefer "bearded gentleman" \ myself.

[Phoenix] (A very long day...)

[Judge] Incidentally,

[Judge] photographic equipment is \ strictly forbidden in this \ courtroom.

[Edgeworth] M-mpht!

[Edgeworth] M-my apologies, Your Honor. \ He said he wouldn't testify \ if he couldn't bring it...

[Edgeworth] I'd like special permission, \ if that's possible.

[Phoenix] Wait, so you're saying you had \ to bargain terms with a kid... \ and you LOST?

[Cody] Hey! I just got \ this new camera!

[Cody] Don't really know how to \ use it all that good yet!

[Cody] But I bring it with me \ wherever I go!

[Mia] Phoenix.

[Mia] I wonder if he had that \ camera on the day of the \ murder...

[Mia] You'd better make a note of \ it in the Court Record.

[Phoenix] You really like the Steel \ Samurai, huh?

[Cody] Course I do!

[Cody] I've taped every show!

[Cody] And I go to all the live \ performances!

[Phoenix] That's impressive.

[Phoenix] Have you been to the \ amusement park?

[Cody] Course! Duh!

[Cody] My Dad always takes me!

[Phoenix] (Poor, poor Dad...)

[Cody] (2) \ I found a map on the Internet, \ and went to the studios that \ day.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Was that day the first time \ you'd been to the studio?

[Cody] Uh, actually I've been a \ couple of times.

[Cody] I never manage to get \ there on a rehearsal day!

[Edgeworth] Right, right. \ Please continue.

[Cody] Chill, pops! \ I'm getting to it!

[Cody] How am I supposed to talk \ with you cuttin' me off \ all the time? Geez!

[Phoenix] "Off the path"...?

[Cody] Yeah, you know how the \ studios are in a valley \ there?

[Cody] If you go off the path \ a little, there's woods. \ That's where I was!

[Cody] Anyhow...

[Cody] (4) \ I was going for the studio.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Did nothing unusual happen \ on your way to the studio?

[Cody] "Unusual"?

[Phoenix] Did you see this monkey \ by any chance?

[Cody] Oh, you mean Mr. Monkey?

[Cody] Yeah I saw him, but \ his head wasn't busted!

[Edgeworth] So you went straight \ to the studio?

[Cody] (5) \ I got kinda lost on the way, \ though. For about 30 minutes.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] You got lost in the woods?

[Cody] Yeah. I couldn't figure \ out which way I was walking.

[Cody] Man, was I relieved when \ I saw the blue studio doors.

[Cody] But guess what happened next!

[Cody] (6) \ When I came out by the studio, \ there was the Steel Samurai!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] The Steel Samurai?

[Cody] Yeah, he was standing by \ the studio gate.

[Cody] It looked like he was \ thinking about something \ before going in.

[Cody] Then he opened up the gate \ and went inside.

[Phoenix] I see. What then?

[Cody] (7) \ It totally rocked! \ Right before my eyes, \ out came the bad guy!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What sort of "bad guy" was it?

[Cody] A guy. A person. \ Kinda tall. Skinny.

[Phoenix] Are you sure it was \ a guy?

[Cody] ...

[Cody] I dunno. \ He was kinda far away.

[Phoenix] (Huh, he's being awfully \ vague...)

[Mia] ...

[Cody] (8) \ Of course, the Steel Samurai \ took him down! Pow!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What happened to the bad guy?

[Cody] Huh?

[Cody] Well...

[Cody] Well, he kinda didn't move. \ Not a bit. Like he was dead.

[Cody] I-I guess he's a real pro! \ What a great actor!

[Phoenix] Y-yes, I suppose he was.

[Cody] (9) \ If I had my camera with \ me, that woulda been the \ time for a shot, I tell you.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "If" you had your camera?

[Phoenix] You mean, you weren't carrying \ your camera then?

[Cody] N-no, I wasn't.

[Cody] I-it's not like I have \ it all the time!

[Phoenix] (Really...?)

[Phoenix] (I guess seeing the killing \ freaked him out and he went \ home...)

[Mia] Use gentle words... \ but be firm.

[Phoenix] (Easy for you to say...)

[Phoenix] Didn't you say before that \ you always bring your digital \ camera wherever you go?

[Phoenix] You were quite clear about \ that.

[Cody] Huh!?

[Phoenix] Cody, you shouldn't lie here. \ You understand that, right?

[Judge] Mr. Wright! \ A word with you...

[Phoenix] (Uh oh... was I putting the \ pressure on too much?)

[Judge] What is this "digital" camera \ contraption you're talking \ about?

[Phoenix] Why?

[Cody] Huh? Whaddya mean, "why"?

[Judge] Well, Mr. Wright. \ Do you have another \ explanation?

[Phoenix] He missed the climax of \ the fight...

[Phoenix] because he was looking at \ something else! Probably!

[Edgeworth] "Probably"?

[Judge] "Something else"?

[Edgeworth] Mr. Wright, \ explain yourself!

[Edgeworth] What could possibly distract \ this boy from seeing his idol, \ the Steel Samurai, fight!?

[Edgeworth] What do you claim he \ was looking at?

[Phoenix] O-ooof!

[Phoenix] (C'mon, think of something... \ think of something... \ Nothing.)

********************************************

[Phoenix] Here's my proof!

[Judge] What's that? \ The camera...?

[Phoenix] The witness stated that he \ recently received this camera.

[Judge] Yes, I'm aware of that.

[Phoenix] He wasn't entirely familiar \ with its operation.

[Judge] I'm aware of that, too.

[Judge] Ah!

[Phoenix] Correct! Why would Cody be \ looking somewhere else at \ the critical moment?

[Phoenix] Because he was looking \ at his camera!

[Phoenix] He was trying to take \ a picture!

[Cody] Hey!

[Phoenix] Bullseye!

[Cody] W-what's your problem, pops! \ You got a thing for picking \ on little kids!?

[Phoenix] (Pressing, not picking...)

[Mia] Good job, Phoenix!

[Mia] Cody was lying, clearly.

[Mia] Samrt of you to realize there \ was no way he could just stand \ there, watching his hero...

[Mia] and not take a picture!

[Phoenix] Right!

[Phoenix] Cody?

[Phoenix] There was only one reason \ why you would have looked \ away from the fight.

[Phoenix] And that was because you \ wanted to take a picture.

[Phoenix] But having just received your \ camera, you weren't used \ to using it yet!

[Phoenix] So, you missed the climax \ of the fight. Correct?

[Cody] ...

[Cody] ...

[Cody] ...

[Cody] Yeah.

[Mia] Well, Phoenix.

[Mia] I'll bet you anything he's \ hiding more than that.

[Mia] Have him testify again!

[Phoenix] R-right. \ (Mia means business!)

[Phoenix] Your Honor.

[Phoenix] The defense would like to \ request that Cody Hackins \ testify once more.

[Judge] V-very well.

[Judge] Cody?

[Judge] Could you please tell us \ about your camera...

[Judge] And about why you didn't \ take a picture of the fight?

[Cody] Umm...

[Phoenix] (Welcome to the real world, \ kid!)

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- No Photo? --

[Cody] (1) \ Yeah, you're right, pops.

[Cody] (2) \ The Steel Samurai had just \ escaped from the clutches of \ the villain.

[Cody] (3) \ So I held up my camera \ to take a picture!

[Cody] (4) \ But the lens wouldn't open \ in time, so I missed it.

[Cody] (5) \ Th-that's all that happened. \ Yup.

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Anything strange in that \ testimony, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] I'm not sure...

[Phoenix] But I'd like to proceed with \ the cross-examination anyway.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- No Photo? --

[Cody] (1) \ Yeah, you're right, pops.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "Pops"...?

[Cody] Yeah, I called you "pops," \ you spiky-haired geezer!

[Phoenix] G-geezer...?

[Edgeworth] I'm "Mr. Edgeworth."

[Judge] And I guess I'm the "bearded \ gentleman"...

[Cody] That's what I hate about \ grown-ups. You'rea ll so \ self-conscious!

[Phoenix] Okay, off with the kid \ gloves! Testify, witness, \ testify!

[Cody] Yipes!

[Cody] (2) \ The Steel Samurai had just \ escaped from the clutches of \ the villain.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So you did see the \ beginning of the fight?

[Cody] Yeah.

[Phoenix] Did you notice anything \ unusual?

[Cody] Umm... well... uh...

[Cody] I guess the Steel Samurai was \ moving a little strange...

[Phoenix] (Moving... strangely?)

[Cody] (3) \ So I held up my camera \ to take a picture!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Why couldn't you take \ a picture?

[Cody] My new camera has too many \ buttons. I couldn't figure \ it out.

[Cody] I tried to take a picture, \ I really tried.

[Cody] (4) \ But the lens wouldn't open \ in time, so I missed it.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] When the lens opened, \ what did you see?

[Cody] Uh... well, a person on \ the ground. And the Steel \ Samurai!

[Cody] (5) \ Th-that's all that happened. \ Yup.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] That's all?

[Cody] Y-yeah! \ I told you, I didn't \ take a picture!

[Phoenix] (Hmm... I would have, once I \ got that lens open...)

[Phoenix] (Did he really not take \ a picture? Not even one?)

***Press him hard***************************

[Phoenix] (Nah, he definitely would \ have taken a picture.)

[Phoenix] (There's got to be something \ here I can use!)

[Phoenix] Cody!

[Phoenix] Listen up, Cody Hackins. \ I know exactly what happened \ that day.

[Phoenix] You took a picture!

[Cody] ... Hey!

[Phoenix] (Bullseye...?)

[Cody] H-how did you know!?

[Phoenix] I see through all your \ lies Cody Hackins. It's \ one of my powers!

[Cody] W-wow!

[Phoenix] (This feels great!)

[Cody] Y-yeah... \ Yeah, I took a picture.

[Judge] Perhaps you can change \ your testimony to reflect \ this, Cody?

[Cody] (5b) \ I took a few shots, but it \ was too late, so I erased 'em.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] You "erased" them?

[Cody] Y-yeah!

[Phoenix] Why would you erase a picture \ of your beloved Steel \ Samurai, victorious?

[Cody] Well... y'know.

[Cody] W-why would I want to \ keep a picture like that?

[Phoenix] (Hmm... he's becoming less \ and less cooperative.)

[Phoenix] (I better find a clear \ contradiction soon... \ or some solid evidence.)

[Phoenix] (How can I pick holes in \ such a short testimony?)

[Mia] There has to be something.

[Mia] Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! \ Find out what this kid's \ all about!

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Cody!

[Cody] Wh-wh-what!?

[Cody] Man, every time you saw \ "Cody" you follow it with \ something bad.

[Phoenix] I just wanted to thank you \ for giving me this the \ other day.

[Cody] Huh? O-oh... right.

[Phoenix] What was it you \ told me then?

[Cody] I go to every live \ performance!

[Cody] I always take a picture when \ the Steel Samurai lands the \ final blow! Whizzam!

[Cody] I got 'em all! I never missed \ one! A perfect collection!

[Phoenix] Cody.

[Phoenix] Did you really get a picture \ of the Steel Samurai standing \ victorious over his foe?

[Phoenix] If you did, I find it hard \ to believe that you would \ just erase it!

[Phoenix] Wouldn't you keep it for \ your album?

[Cody] Ah!

[Judge] Mr. Wright...

[Judge] What exactly is this album?

[Phoenix] It's called "Path to Glory."

[Phoenix] It's a collection of pictures \ of the Steel Samurai, all \ taken by Cody Hackins.

[Phoenix] He claims it's a perfect \ collection of every battle \ the Steel Samurai has won!

[Judge] I... I see.

[Phoenix] Don't you find this very \ odd, Your Honor?

[Phoenix] Among all his pictures of \ the Steel Samurai, none \ were taken that day!

[Judge] Order!

[Judge] Mr. Wright. \ Have you an explanation?

[Judge] If the Steel Samurai \ had just defeated his \ adversary...

[Judge] I certainly would expect \ to see a picture of it \ in this album...

[Phoenix] Exactly my point, \ Your Honor!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] .........! \ (No... wait... no way!)

[Mia] Phoenix?

[Mia] I think we've finally \ discovered the truth.

[Mia] And what a truth it is!

[Phoenix] M-Mia... are we sure \ about this?

[Phoenix] Did he actually...?

[Mia] Yes.

[Mia] I'm pretty sure what you're \ thinking is right.

[Mia] Tell them, Phoenix. \ Tell them what the truth is.

[Judge] Mr. Wright! \ Please explain to the court \ what is going on here!

[Judge] Why was there no picture in \ the album from the day of \ the murder?

[Judge] Why would the boy have \ erased the photos he took?

***The photos were blurry*******************

[Phoenix] I believe that Cody Hackins \ is what we call an "artiste."

[Judge] An... "artiste"...?

[Phoenix] He didn't like the photos \ he had taken!

[Phoenix] They were blurry, or maybe \ his framing was off...

[Phoenix] Anyway, for some reason, \ he erased the data!

[Judge] Is that right, Cody?

[Cody] Wh-what do you mean \ "framing was off"!?

[Judge] It seems the only thing "off" \ is your guesswork, Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] Um, uh...

[Phoenix] Yes, well, I'm sure \ the reall reason is...

[Judge] Yes? The real reason is?

***He erased them by mistake****************

[Phoenix] Simple, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] Cody wasn't used to using \ his new camera.

[Phoenix] He erased those photos \ he took by mistake!

[Mia] W-wait a second, Phoenix.

[Mia] If that's your answer, we're \ back where we started!

[Phoenix] Huh? You mean, that wasn't it?

***The Steel Samurai didn't win*************

[Phoenix] I can think of only \ one reason, your honor.

[Phoenix] The Steel Samurai didn't win!

[Phoenix] That's why Cody deleted \ those photos.

[Judge] You mean the Steel Samurai... \ lost?

[Phoenix] Well, Cody? \ I'm right, aren't I?

[Phoenix] Tell the truth. The bad guy \ defeated the Steel Samurai!

[Cody] N-n-n-no way! No!

[Cody] I-it's impossible! \ Th-the Steel Samurai \ never loses!

[Cody] He never loses to anyone! \ Ever!

[Phoenix] Your Honor...

[Phoenix] The witness has revealed \ everything with his words.

[Phoenix] There was a reason why \ he lied and told us he \ didn't take a picture.

[Phoenix] The same reason he erased \ his precious photos!

[Phoenix] For Cody, it was inconceivable \ that the Steel Samurai could \ be defeated.

[Phoenix] However, Cody witnessed \ the impossible!

[Phoenix] He saw the Steel Samurai lose!

[Phoenix] Yet to admit what he saw \ would destroy everything \ he believed in!

[Phoenix] That's why he lied and said \ the Steel Samurai won.

[Phoenix] He couldn't handle the truth!

[Judge] O-Order! I will have order!

[Judge] W-witness! I mean, Cody! \ Is this true!?

[Cody] Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell \ down...

[Cody] Th-then he didn't m-move...

[Cody] Waaaaaaaaah!

[Judge] Order! Order! Order!

[Edgeworth] What kind of stunt are you \ trying to pull, Wright!?

[Edgeworth] The Steel Samurai was the \ murderer, not the victim!

[Phoenix] Yet according to your \ witness's testimony, the Steel \ Samurai was the one who fell!

[Judge] Mr. Wright! \ What's going on?

[Phoenix] Apparently, we have all made \ a serious error.

[Edgeworth] An... error?

[Edgeworth] What's this all about!?

***Hammer was the victim********************

[Phoenix] Quite simply, the victim \ was Jack Hammer!

[Phoenix] It was a draw!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

********************************************

[Phoenix] If you understand what \ really happened, it's \ actually quite simple.

[Phoenix] At the end of the fight, \ the Steel Samurai fell to \ the ground, and lay still.

[Phoenix] In other words, the Steel \ Samurai was not the killer, \ he was the victim!

[Phoenix] Don't you see?

[Phoenix] Jack Hammer was the Steel \ Samurai!

[Judge] Order! Order! Order!

[Judge] So, the Steel Samurai \ in this photograph...

[Judge] You're saying the man in this \ costume was the victim, \ Mr. Jack Hammer?

[Phoenix] That's what I'm saying, \ Your Honor.

[Phoenix] Jack Hammer was present at the \ action scene run-through \ that morning.

[Phoenix] Thus, he obviously knew about \ Will Powers's foot injury.

[Judge] B-but wait!

[Judge] Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone \ to Studio One already?

[Phoenix] That's what everyone thought!

[Phoenix] But remember what Ms. Oldbag \ said in her testimony?

[Oldbag] On the day of the murder, \ I arrived at the guard \ station at 1:00 PM.

[Oldbag] Did I see poor old Hammer? \ Nope.

[Oldbag] He'd already gone to the \ studio before I got back \ to the guard station.

[Phoenix] Mr. Jack Hammer left the \ Employee Area after lunch.

[Phoenix] However, no one saw him \ going to Studio One.

[Phoenix] Nor was there a \ picture of him.

[Phoenix] He waited for Mr. Powers \ to take a nap in his \ dressing room.

[Phoenix] Then he snuck into the \ dressing room and stole \ the Steel Samurai costume.

[Judge] ...

[Edgeworth] ...

[Judge] But why would the \ victim do such a thing?

[Phoenix] I... don't know.

[Cody] ...

[Cody] I get it!

[Phoenix] ?

[Cody] I thought that the Steel \ Samurai was moving strange.

[Cody] So it was a different \ person inside the suit!

[Cody] Pops!

[Phoenix] Huh, me? What?

[Cody] Actually, there was one \ piece of data I saved.

[Phoenix] Data?

[Cody] Yeah, a photo on my \ digital camera!

[Phoenix] !

[Phoenix] W-what!?

[Edgeworth] Show us, quick!

[Cody] No way man, not if you're \ gonna look at me like that!

[Judge] Now!

[Cody] *sniff*

[Cody] Here... \ This is it.

[Judge] ...

[Judge] Well, looking at this it's \ still a little hard to say.

[Judge] I'm afraid that it could \ be anyone in that costume.

[Judge] Your opinion, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] I agree, Your Honor. \ This isn't decisive evidence.

[Judge] I'm sorry, this doesn't look \ like it's the proof we need.

[Judge] I'll give it back.

[Mia] Wait, Phoenix!

[Phoenix] Mia? What?

[Mia] Look at that photo once more!

[Mia] That's it Phoenix!

[Mia] That photo is all the evidence \ you need to win this trial!

[Phoenix] Wh-what!?

[Phoenix] Y-Your Honor!

[Phoenix] May I see that photo \ once more please?

[Judge] C-certainly. \ I don't see why not.

[Mia] Phoenix! \ Show him!

[Mia] There's a glaring, decisive \ inconsistency with the facts \ as we know them in that photo!

[Phoenix] (Find the inconsistency \ in the photo!)

***Present the Steel Samurai****************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] It's right here!

[Judge] The Steel Samurai...?

[Phoenix] Yes, that's about the only \ thing in this picture that \ could be inconsistent.

[Phoenix] The Steel Samurai is \ inconsistent with... \ something.

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Wright!

[Edgeworth] This is no time for \ daydreaming and pointless \ pontification!

[Edgeworth] Think about your client, and \ us, who are forced to listen \ to your rambling!

[Judge] Ah yes. Well, it's hard to \ see, but it looks like a "2."

[Phoenix] Clearly not a "1," Your \ Honor, correct?

[Edgeworth] Aaaaaah!

[Phoenix] I believe Mr. Edgeworth \ sees what I'm getting at.

[Edgeworth] B-but...

[Edgeworth] Th-that's impossible!

[Phoenix] I'll use the studio guidemap.

[Phoenix] The body was found here, \ in Studio One.

[Phoenix] However, what do we see \ in this photo taken at the \ time of the murder?

[Phoenix] It does NOT say "1" on that \ gate in the photo.

[Phoenix] Here is the true \ scene of the crime!

[Phoenix] (Show the judge where \ the murder took place!)

***Present somewhere wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Judge] What does that have to do \ with the number on the gate \ in the photograph...?

[Phoenix] Umm... well...

***The trailer was there********************

[Phoenix] As you may recall, there is \ a trailer in Studio Two.

[Phoenix] The path to the trailer \ was blocked!

[Phoenix] In other words, the victim \ went to Studio Two before \ that time!

[Judge] Yes... yes, I suppose \ that would be the case.

[Phoenix] Remember Mr. Sal Manella's \ testimony?

[Phoenix] Allow me to remind the court:

[Phoenix] He said no one in the trailer \ was guilty because they could \ not have gone to Studio One.

[Judge] Your homework is to find \ the answer to the following \ question:

[Judge] Why would Mr. Hammer steal \ the Steel Samurai costume?

[Judge] Also, who killed him, \ and why?

[Judge] Find the answers for \ me by tomorrow.

[Phoenix] (That's a lot of homework!)

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth.

[Edgeworth] Mm?

[Judge] You will need to reconsider \ your stance in this case.

[Judge] Above all, you will need to \ reconsider your suspicion \ of Mr. Will Powers.

[Edgeworth] As you say, Your Honor.

[Judge] This trial will be extended \ until tomorrow. This is the \ last extension!

[Judge] Very well... \ Court is adjourned!

[Phoenix] Whew!

[Phoenix] That was a close one!

[Mia] We were saved by a hair, \ but that's all that counts.

[Mia] I thought seriously about \ going home about three \ times during the trial.

[Phoenix] M-me too!

[Will] Really?

[Will] You both seemed so... \ so confident!

[Phoenix] Hah! Maybe I should take \ up a career in acting?

[Phoenix] I was ready to pronounce \ you dead about three times \ back there.

[Mia] Me too!

[Will] D-dead!?

[Mia] Hoh hoh. Of course, we're \ kidding.

[Will] Are you sure?

[Phoenix] (I wasn't kidding...)

[Phoenix] Now, Mr. Powers.

[Phoenix] We have to go make \ our final investigation.

[Phoenix] But I promise you, we'll \ find the true killer by \ tomorrow's trial!

[Will] R-right! Thanks! \ *sniff*

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green October 19, 3:27 PM \ Wright & Co. Law Offices

[Phoenix] That was a close one, \ huh, Mia?

[Maya] Really? \ Too bad, I'm sorry \ I missed it.

[Phoenix] ?

[Phoenix] M-Maya!

[Maya] So, what happened?

[Phoenix] Well, I think I've \ got a pretty good \ idea who did it.

[Phoenix] Now all I need is a motive... \ and proof.

[Maya] Wow! Good going, Nick!

[Phoenix] Under the "initial trial" \ system, tomorrow is the \ last day we have.

[Maya] "Initial trial"...? \ What's that?

[Phoenix] That's the new court system \ they introduced two or three \ years ago.

[Phoenix] They had so many cases in \ the system, they decided to \ speed the whole process up.

[Maya] So, under that system, trials \ have to end in three days?

[Phoenix] Yeah, pretty much.

[Phoenix] Well, we've no \ time to waste!

[] ...

***Present Powers's(?) Photo****************

[Phoenix] (Who would have thought that \ it was Jack Hammer inside!)

[Phoenix] (But why did he steal it? \ That's what I have to \ figure out.)

[Maya] ...?

********************************************

***Present Samurai Spear********************

[Maya] I wish I had my own \ Samurai Spear!

[Maya] Just think, I could \ poke you as much as I wanted!

[Phoenix] Me!? Why me!?

********************************************

***Present "Path to Glory"******************

[Phoenix] What do you think about \ this? It's that fanboy's \ prized possession.

[Maya] Wow! Impressive!

[Maya] ...

[Maya] It's a little different from \ the Steel Samurai on TV...

[Phoenix] These are mostly taken at \ those PR shows they do at \ stores and fairs...

[Phoenix] I'm pretty sure it's not \ even Will Powers inside \ that suit.

[Maya] No true fan would be \ satisfied with anything \ less than the real thing!

[Maya] He's still a child, \ I suppose...

[Maya] I guess it takes an adult \ to appreciate the real \ deal. Right, Nick?

[Phoenix] Um, yeah, whatever you say.

********************************************

***Present Cody's Camera********************

[Phoenix] This is Cody's--

[Maya] Hey! A digital camera!

[Maya] I'm impressed a kid like \ him would have something \ this expensive.

[Maya] Kids these days!

[Phoenix] (I don't imagine spirit \ mediums-in-training get \ a lot of toys...)

********************************************

***Talk about "The Steel Samurai"***********

[Phoenix] I don't get it, Maya.

[Phoenix] Why would Mr. Hammer steal \ the Steel Samurai costume?

[Maya] What!? You mean Mr. Hammer \ was wearing the costume!?

[Phoenix] Yeah!

[Maya] B-but Mr. Hammer was the \ victim, Nick!

[Maya] Why would he go through the \ trouble of stealing it?

[Phoenix] That's what we have \ to find out.

********************************************

***Talk about "The director's alibi"********

[Maya] What happened with the \ director's testimony?

[Phoenix] Well, it's pretty clear that \ the producer and the director \ were both in the trailer.

[Maya] Huh...

[Phoenix] Which means that the killer \ has to be one of them!

[Maya] Really!? Why?

[Phoenix] Because the real scene of the \ crime was Studio Two... where \ that trailer is!

[Maya] Whaaaat!?

[Phoenix] (Hmm... was Maya always \ this excitable?)

********************************************

***Talk about "Any ideas"*******************

[Phoenix] Well, have you noticed \ anything that might help us?

[Maya] I can't see what's going \ on when Mia is here...

[Maya] So, no. I haven't noticed \ anything.

[Phoenix] Right...

[Maya] Maybe we should go \ talk to WP?

[Phoenix] (WP... Powers... right.)

********************************************

[] MOVE TO: Detention Center

[] ...

[] October 19 \ Detention Center \ Visitor's Room

[Will] Mr. Wright! \ You did very well again \ today... thank you!

[Phoenix] Oh... thanks.

[Phoenix] Um, could you not look like \ you're about to burst into \ tears...?

[Maya] Wow, Nick! You must have \ really wowed 'em in there.

[Phoenix] You could stop looking \ so... vulnerable, too.

[Maya] Hey, WP! Only one day \ left!

[Maya] Let's make it count!

[Will] Yes...

[Will] Though there's not really \ anything I can do to help.

[Maya] Hah hah hah! I'm not really \ sure what I can do, either.

[Phoenix] Please... this is no laughing \ matter.

[] ...

***Present Powers's(?) Photo****************

[Phoenix] Here's that picture again.

[Will] I-is that really Jack Hammer \ inside that suit?

[Phoenix] He's the only one who it \ could have been.

[Will] But why would he...?

[Maya] Yeah! Why?

[Phoenix] You're the medium! Why don't \ you summon up Mr. Hammer's \ spirit and ask him yourself?

[Maya] *sigh* \ Gimme about three more years.

[Phoenix] (Look at us, the two novices.)

********************************************

***Present "Path to Glory"******************

[Phoenix] Have you seen this, \ Mr. Powers?

[Will] W-what's that!?

[Will] I've never seen these \ Steel Samurais in \ my life...

[Phoenix] These are the Steel \ Samurais that appear at \ live shows.

[Phoenix] A fanboy collected all \ these pictures himself.

[Will] ...

[Will] Seeing things like \ this really makes \ me think...

[Will] I mean so much to these \ kids, you know? *sniff*

********************************************

***Present other****************************

[Will] E-excuse me.

[Will] Thank you for showing \ me that, whatever it is.

[Will] I wish I could think \ of some way for me to \ help you...

[Will] S-sorry. *sniff*

********************************************

***Talk about "Producer Vasquez"************

[Phoenix] Could you tell me more \ about Ms. Vasquez?

[Will] Oh... the producer?

[Will] She's well respected in \ the industry. They say \ she's a genius.

[Maya] A genius...?

[Will] She's been at Global \ Studios for five years now.

[Will] Right or wrong, nobody \ dares tell her different \ these days.

[Phoenix] Why is that?

[Will] Ever since she came on board, \ we've had nothing but hits.

[Will] Global Studios was on its \ knees, but she picked it \ up and made it shine.

[Will] Oh, and...

[Maya] And... what?

[Will] N-nothing. Forget it.

[Will] I... I've only heard rumors, \ anyhow.

********************************************

***Talk about "Director Manella"************

[Phoenix] Can you tell me anything \ about Mr. Manella?

[Will] Oh, he used to be a minor \ straight-to-video director.

[Will] But something in his work \ caught Vasquez's eye.

[Will] She brought the Steel \ Samurai idea to him.

[Will] Now everyone knows the \ name Sal Manella.

[Will] I hear he's pretty much \ at her beck and call, though.

[Will] Whenever she says "jump!" \ he asks "how high?" and \ all that.

[Phoenix] (I can imagine him being at \ her beck and call... though \ I can't imagine him jumping.)

********************************************

***Talk about "Mr. Hammer"******************

[Maya] I was wondering about \ Mr. Hammer...

[Maya] He was a big star back \ in the day, right?

[Maya] But then he just dropped \ off the face of the Earth.

[Will] Oh...

[Will] Yes, you're right. In fact, \ he was my role model when I \ started in this business.

[Will] But he just stopped taking \ on big roles.

[Will] That's when he began \ appearing in little \ productions at Global...

[Maya] How could he do that!?

[Maya] I was really looking \ forward to a sequel \ to "Samurai Summer."

[Will] He just gave up being \ a star five years ago.

[Will] Actually, now that \ I think about it...

[Will] That was right when \ Ms. Vasquez came to \ Global.

[Phoenix] (Five years ago...?)

[Maya] You know, his place is \ really... peaceful, like this.

[Oldbag] ...

[Maya] Nick?

[Maya] I think her guard's down...

[Phoenix] Y-yeah?

[Maya] I bet we could even eat \ those donuts in the guard \ station... if we wanted.

[Oldbag] ...

[Oldbag] You eat, you die.

[Maya] Whew! She's alive!

***Present Powers's(?) Photo****************

[Phoenix] Um, Ms. Oldbag?

********************************************

***Present other****************************

[Phoenix] Um, Ms. Oldbag? \ What do you think of this?

[Oldbag] Think? \ I'm not in the mood for \ thinking, thank you very much.

********************************************

***Talk about "Producer Vasquez"************

[Phoenix] Um, I was wondering about \ Dee Vasquez, the producer.

[Oldbag] Oh, the studio bigwigs \ LOVE her.

[Oldbag] So she always gets her way.

[Phoenix] (She seems bitter...)

[Maya] Do you... not like \ the producer?

[Oldbag] Look, the studio people \ don't want me talking about \ her, so, sorry.

********************************************

***Talk about "Director Manella"************

[Phoenix] Can I ask you about \ Sal Manella, the director?

[Oldbag] Sal? He's soft--a pushover. \ Does whatever Vasquez \ tells him to.

[Oldbag] She treats him like dirt, \ but I think he likes it.

[Maya] Huh? Why would anyone like \ being treated like dirt?

[Maya] That doesn't make any sense, \ does it, Nick?

[Phoenix] Er... \ No, no it doesn't, Maya.

********************************************

***Talk about "Mr. Hammer"******************

[Phoenix] About Mr. Hammer...

[Oldbag] Arrgh!

[Oldbag] I heard about what yous aid \ today! Cheeky whippersnapper!

[Oldbag] Poor old Hammer! \ You'd drag his star down from \ the sky and stomp on it!

[Oldbag] Calling him a criminal! \ A thief!

[Oldbag] I-I-I-I... \ I won't forget this!!!

[Phoenix] (Uh oh, she's really \ pissed this time!)

[Oldbag] You listen to me, whipper- \ snapper! My poor old Hammer \ would never do such a thing!

[Oldbag] Why would he steal Powers's \ costume so he could sneak \ by me?

[Oldbag] He would never stoop \ so low! It's impossible!

[Phoenix] Right.

[Maya] But why?

[Maya] I wonder if someone called \ him...? Like the director, \ or the producer...?

[Maya] Say, Nick, how did you \ figure that out again?

[Phoenix] Well...

[Phoenix] Actually, it's a long story, \ I'll tell you another time.

[Maya] Aww.

********************************************

[Phoenix] There's a big "2" painted \ here.

[Phoenix] So this is the number \ in Cody's photograph.

[Phoenix] And to think, if he hadn't \ brought that photograph in...

[Maya] Don't get all teary eyed yet.

********************************************

[Phoenix] This is where Sal Manella \ and Dee Vasquez ate.

[Phoenix] There's nothing left \ on the plates.

[Maya] Hey, so they ate t-bone \ steaks too.

********************************************

***Talk about "Mr. Hammer"******************

[Maya] Um, excuse me? Mr. Hammer \ came here on the day of \ the murder, and...

[Vasquez] Shh.

[Maya] ?

[Vasquez] Perhaps you didn't hear me.

[Vasquez] I'm watching the clouds.

[Vasquez] I'm not interested in \ talking to you.

[Maya] Do something, Nick! \ She's really ticking me off!

[Phoenix] (Oh dear...)

********************************************

***Talk about "Will Powers"*****************

[Maya] Umm... Mr. Powers wasn't \ the killer!

[Maya] You don't have to \ cancel the Steel Samurai!

[] MOVE TO: Outside Studio Two \ Studio - Main Gate \ Employee Area

[] ...

[] October 19 \ Global Studios \ Employee Area

[Maya] I guess they're not \ filming today, either.

[Maya] I did want to see them \ filming... just one time.

[Phoenix] This trial will be over and \ done by tomorrow. You can \ come see them film later.

[Maya] I guess...

[Maya] This is where you found \ that bottle of sleeping \ pills, right?

[Phoenix] Uh huh.

[Maya] I wonder if there're any \ other clues lying around.

[Gumshoe] Yaaaaaaa \ aaaaaaaaaarh!

[Gumshoe] No no no! \ No touchin'!

[Maya] Eeek!

[Gumshoe] Oh, sorry, pal.

[Gumshoe] Didn't mean to \ frighten you.

[Maya] D-didn't mean...? \ I almost had a heart attack!

[Gumshoe] Heh heh. \ I guess I can be a little \ dramatique at times...

[Gumshoe] I suppose it's the actor \ in me...

[Phoenix] ("Dramatique" indeed...)

[Gumshoe] Ahem.

[Gumshoe] Anyway, I'm here to examine \ the plate on that table.

[Phoenix] Wait, are you looking \ for sleeping pills?

[Gumshoe] Yeah, pal. Traces thereof.

[] ...

***Examine open grate***********************

[Phoenix] That grate's still \ lying here.

[Maya] They know if they fixed it \ I'd just kick it off again.

[Phoenix] Huh. It's so... normal.

********************************************

***Examine nearest table********************

[Phoenix] The remains of the employees' \ lunch are scattered around.

[Phoenix] Everyone was probably too \ shocked to clean up.

[Phoenix] There's a t-bone on one of \ the plates, minus the steak.

********************************************

***Present anything*************************

[Gumshoe] I'm guessing I know as \ much about that as you \ do, pal, i.e. nothing.

********************************************

***Talk about "The plate"*******************

[Maya] So you're looking for traces \ of the sleeping pills... how?

[Gumshoe] For a thorough examination \ I gotta take the plate back \ to the precinct.

[Gumshoe] But I have the capabilities \ to make a cursory examination \ right here!

[Gumshoe] Our science guy gave me \ some testing solution.

[Gumshoe] This reacts to sleeping \ pills, see? If there're traces \ it'll change color.

[Maya] Wow! Neat!

[Maya] Well, Detective Gumshoe? \ What are you waiting for?

[Gumshoe] Now, now, everything \ in due time, pal.

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] Well, the testing solution \ on the plate changed color \ alright.

[Phoenix] So there were sleeping pills \ on the plate!

[Gumshoe] Looks like it.

[] Steak Plate added to \ the Court Record.

********************************************

***Present Steak Plate**********************

[Gumshoe] It's looking like Will Powers \ was drugged...

[Gumshoe] I'm going to go back to \ the precinct to do some \ more detailed tests.

[Maya] You're being very... free with \ your information today, \ Detective.

[Gumshoe] Well... don't go telling \ anyone this, pal.

[Gumshoe] But I was kind of impressed \ at today's trial, too.

[Maya] ...!

[Gumshoe] Most lawyers would've given \ up after that director's \ testimony.

[Gumshoe] I think if it'd been anyone \ but you up there, Powers would \ be done for by now.

********************************************

***Talk about "The investigation"***********

[Phoenix] How goes your investigation?

[Gumshoe] To tell the truth, it's a \ real mess, pal.

[Gumshoe] Some people think we should \ pursue the case we already \ have against Powers...

[Gumshoe] And some people think we \ should switch suspects!

[Maya] What do you think, Detective \ Gumshoe?

[Gumshoe] Well, pal, I hate \ to admit it...

[Gumshoe] But I'm not sure I buy the \ case against Mr. Powers any \ more.

[Gumshoe] I feel kind of bad for \ Mr. Edgeworth, though.

********************************************

***Talk about "Prosecutor Edgeworth"********

[Phoenix] How is Edgeworth doing, \ anyway?

[Gumshoe] Edgeworth is out of control!

[Gumshoe] He was in the waiting room \ and he crushed this paper cup \ with hot, hot coffee in it.

[Phoenix] Whoa...

[Gumshoe] Talk about burns, pal!

[Maya] Wow! The fury of Edgeworth!

[] CONTINUE FOR FIRST TIME ONLY

[Phoenix] Yeah, crushing paper cups...

[Phoenix] (Cups... bottles...?)

[Phoenix] Say, what ever happened \ with that empty bottle?

[Gumshoe] Oh, the bottle of sleeping \ pills?

[Gumshoe] Well, I got some good \ news for you about that.

[Gumshoe] They found the victim, \ Jack Hammer's prints on \ the bottle.

[Maya] So that means...

[Gumshoe] Yep, it sounds like the one \ who put Powers to sleep was \ none other than... the victim!

[Phoenix] (So I was right!)

[] Sleeping Pill Bottle added \ to the Court Record.

********************************************

***Present Sleeping Pill Bottle*************

[Phoenix] Detective, about that \ bottle...

[Gumshoe] Oh, that? Talk about \ embarrassing, pal!

[Gumshoe] I can't believe I missed \ that on my first sweep for \ evidence.

[Gumshoe] Don't know how I can apologize \ to Mr. Edgeworth.

[Maya] It must be tough being a \ detective, with all that \ responsibility...

[Gumshoe] Oh, heh heh. *blush*

***Examine cosmetics************************

[Phoenix] There's an array of \ cosmetics here.

[Phoenix] This is the wig used in \ "Samurai Boogey-Woogey."

[Maya] Wow! \ You remembered, Nick!

***Present Sleeping Pill Bottle*************

***Talk about "Mr. Hammer"******************

[Phoenix] I was wondering if I could \ ask you about Mr. Hammer...

[Penny] Yes?

[Phoenix] On the day of the murder, \ he went to Studio Two.

[Penny] Huh? I thought he went \ to Studio One?

[Maya] He stole the Steel Samurai \ costume, too!

[Penny] What!?

[Penny] Why would Mr. Hammer do \ something like that?

[Penny] ...

[Penny] Oh...

[Penny] I guess the rumor must be \ true, then.

[Maya] The rumor?

[Penny] Yeah. Mr. Vasquez, that \ producer, had some kind of \ hold on Hammer.

[Penny] She had some dirt on him... \ He'd do anything she \ said, apparently.

[Maya] Some "dirt"?

[Maya] What dirt!

[Penny] ...

[Penny] Dirt. You know, bad stuff.

[Maya] ...

[Maya] Um, I know what dirt means...

[Penny] About five years ago, they \ were filming a movie starring \ Mr. Hammer.

[Penny] They were using the new \ studio... Studio Two.

[Penny] Some sort of accident \ happened during filming.

[Penny] After that, they never used \ Studio Two again.

[Penny] They left the film set the \ way it was, too.

[Phoenix] (The film set...? Was that \ trailer part of the film \ set, then?)

********************************************

***Talk about "The last episode"************

[Maya] W-what do you mean, \ the "last Steel Samurai"!?

[Penny] I know it's a shock, \ but nothing can be done \ to save it now.

[Penny] Whoever really did kill \ Mr. Hammer, also signed the \ Steel Samurai's death warrant.

[Maya] No... no!

[Penny] Also, I hear that Global \ Studios is going to change \ its programming.

[Penny] They're not going to make \ kids' shows anymore.

[Maya] W-what!? \ Why!?

[Penny] I don't know.

[Penny] It's sad, but that's what \ Global Studios decided.

********************************************

***Talk about "Five years ago"**************

[Phoenix] An accident five years ago?

[Penny] Yes, in Studio Two.

[Penny] That trailer there was \ part of the film set.

[Phoenix] Could you tell us \ what happened?

[Penny] ...

[Penny] S-sorry.

[Penny] I don't think I can.

[Penny] They really don't want \ us to talk about it.

********************************************

***Talk about "Studio policy"***************

[Phoenix] Why aren't they going to make \ kids' shows anymore?

[Penny] The studio bigwigs don't \ want the Steel Samurai \ around anymore.

[Penny] They want to forget all \ this ever happened.

[Penny] They want it quiet, you \ understand?

[Maya] H-how can they just do that!

[Maya] What about all the kids \ who love the Steel Samurai!

[Penny] It's okay. I'm sure the \ kids will be fine.

[Penny] They'll find a new \ hero to follow.

[Maya] No, that can't be true!

[Maya] If the program just ends, \ they'll be heartbroken \ for sure!

[Maya] N-Nick! \ Say something!

[Phoenix] Umm... yeah.

[Phoenix] (I think evidence, rather \ than words, is called \ for here.)

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Penny] And this is...?

[Phoenix] A fan collected all of \ these photographs.

[Phoenix] The kids love the Steel \ Samurai!

[Phoenix] The show shouldn't be \ cancelled just so some \ adults can save face!

[Phoenix] I would think you would \ understand that better \ than anyone.

[Penny] ...

[Penny] ...

[Penny] You're right...

[Penny] Okay!

[Penny] But what can I do?

[Phoenix] Well, for starters...

[Phoenix] You can tell me something.

[Phoenix] Tell me what it is that \ Global Studios is so intent \ on hiding?

[Phoenix] Tell me about this accident \ five years ago.

[Penny] ...

[Penny] Okay!

********************************************

***Talk about "Five years ago"**************

[Phoenix] Could you tell us what \ happened five years ago?

[Penny] Well, I can tell you \ what I've heard.

[Penny] Apparently, five years ago, \ someone died... and it was \ Hammer's fault.

[Maya] S-someone died!?

[Penny] It was an accident, of course!

[Penny] Anyway...

[Penny] The producer, Ms. Vasquez \ managed to hush it up.

[Phoenix] And that's the "dirt" she \ had on Mr. Hammer?

[Maya] And that's why Mr. Hammer \ would do anything Ms. Vasquez \ asked him to do!

[Maya] ...

[Maya] But, it was an accident, \ right? Why didn't they just \ make it public?

[Penny] Well, you know Mr. Hammer \ was a big star back then.

[Penny] They were afraid about what \ would happen to his career \ if word got out.

[Maya] I see...

[Penny] You know who knows mre \ about this? Ms. Oldbag.

[Penny] She was here at the studios \ back then, you know.

[Phoenix] Thanks. \ We'll try asking her.

[Phoenix] (If she'll talk...)

[Oldbag] What, you're still slinking \ around?

[Oldbag] If you like the place so \ much, why don't you take \ over for me?

[Maya] The old windbag doesn't \ look so good...

[Oldbag] E-everybody's doing their \ darnedest to forget Hammer.

[Oldbag] Who do they think made \ Global Studios what it \ is today?

[Oldbag] Hammer! \ It's all due to Hammer!

[Maya] She's starting to froth \ at the mouth, Nick...

[Maya] Maybe we should keep a safe \ distance?

***Present anything*************************

[Oldbag] Sorry...

[Oldbag] I don't want to think \ about it anymore.

[Phoenix] Umm...

[Phoenix] I wanted to ask you about \ five years ago...

[Oldbag] !

[Oldbag] Who told!? \ Who did you hear that from!?

[Oldbag] Nichols!

[Phoenix] N-nickels?

[Maya] Nichols, Nick. Penny Nichols. \ That assistant we talked to.

[Phoenix] O-oh, right.

[Phoenix] Anyway, we heard about \ the accident.

[Phoenix] It was during filming with \ Jack Hammer...

[Phoenix] He killed a man. Didn't he?

[Oldbag] Wh-whippersnappers!

[Oldbag] Dredging up dirt on someone's \ past like that... and the \ recently departed, no less!

[Oldbag] I suppose you think \ this is fun!?

[Phoenix] N-no, I'm just doing my job \ to protect Mr. Powers...

[Oldbag] And you claim that Hammer \ stole Powers's costume!

[Oldbag] You expect me to believe \ that rubbush!?

[Oldbag] Or do you have some \ kind of proof?

[Phoenix] (Proof that Hammer stole \ Powers's costume? Hmm...)

[Oldbag] Poor, poor Hammer.

[Oldbag] You did wrong, Hammer, \ rest your soul.

[Maya] Ms. Oldbag...?

[Oldbag] Okay. You win. \ I'll talk.

[Oldbag] I'm tired, see... \ Tired of holding it all in.

[Phoenix] Ms. Oldbag...

[Oldbag] You're right. Five years ago \ there was an accident... \ a fatal accident.

[Oldbag] What's worse, a paparazzi \ took a photo of it.

[Oldbag] That photo, well, it caused \ quite a stir.

[Oldbag] And guess who made it \ all better? Vasquez!

[Oldbag] She has ties to the \ mafia...

[Oldbag] She silenced that paparazzi.

[Oldbag] That was the beginning.

[Oldbag] After that, she became a \ force to be reckoned with \ here at the studio.

[Maya] I see...!

[Oldbag] But, you have to understand...

[Oldbag] Poor old Hammer never meant \ any harm to anyone!

[Maya] Ms. Oldbag...

[Oldbag] Hold on a minute.

[Maya] Poor Ms. Oldbag...

[Oldbag] Here, take this.

[Phoenix] ...? \ A photograph?

[Phoenix] W-wait a second!

[Oldbag] This is the picture.

[Phoenix] Is... this the trailer \ in Studio Two?

[Oldbag] Hammer was supposed to fight \ with a bad guy on the top \ of those stairs, there.

[Oldbag] He pushed the other actor, \ and the man fell onto the \ flowerbox fence.

[Oldbag] B-but how did you get this?

[Oldbag] It... was a long time ago. \ I don't feel much like \ talking about it.

[Phoenix] I understand...

[] Five-Year-Old Photo added \ to the Court Record.

********************************************

***Present Five-Year-Old Photo**************

[Oldbag] Poor old Hammer. He was \ a big star. The biggest.

[Oldbag] That accident five years \ ago is what did him in.

[Oldbag] He wanted to hide it. \ He didn't want anyone to know.

[Oldbag] Poor, silly old Hammer. \ If he had just come out \ and confessed...

[Oldbag] Then Vasquez wouldn't have \ gotten her claws into him!

********************************************

[] MOVE TO: Employee Area

[Maya] Detective Gumshoe \ must have left by now.

[Phoenix] He's probably thinking \ about what to do in \ tomorrow's trial.

[Maya] I bet Edgeworth is \ pretty angry with him.

[Maya] The assistant must \ have gone off somewhere.

[Maya] That stuff about Mr. Hammer \ must have come as a shock \ to her.

[Phoenix] Wh-what?

[Vasquez] Where did you get that?

[Phoenix] I, well...

[Vasquez] Oldbag.

[Phoenix] O-Old...?

[Maya] She means the security lady, \ Ms. Oldbag, Nick.

[Phoenix] Right... anyway...

[Phoenix] Ms. Vasquez.

[Phoenix] You hid this incident from \ the press, didn't you?

[Phoenix] And you used it to control \ Mr. Hammer!

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] The wind.

[Phoenix] The... huh?

[Vasquez] It's gotten stronger, don't \ you think? The wind.

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] Your conversation interests \ me.

[Vasquez] Let's talk about it more \ inside the trailer.

[Maya] Nick. \ She went inside the trailer.

********************************************

[] MOVE TO: Trailer

[] ...

[Vasquez] Hmph. You came.

[Vasquez] Well then, what was that \ you were talking about?

[Phoenix] (...! \ Why is she so eager to \ talk all of a sudden?)

[Phoenix] Ms. Vasquez.

[Phoenix] You were using that accident!

[Phoenix] You were blackmailing \ Mr. Hammer so you could \ control him, weren't you?

[Phoenix] That's why he was doing \ kids' shows for petty change.

[Vasquez] Hmph...

[Vasquez] So I'm a blackmailer now?

[Maya] Well, that's what it was, \ wasn't it!

[Maya] I mean, sure, it was \ an accident...

[Maya] But you used it to drag \ Mr. Hammer down from his \ rightful place as a star!

[Vasquez] Oh...?

[Vasquez] I haven't pulled anyone down \ from anywhere.

[Vasquez] Mr. Hammer's career went \ sour of its own accord.

[Maya] B-but!

[Maya] You were the cause! \ You pressured him...

[Maya] And to think it was \ just an accident...!

[Vasquez] Excuse me!

[Vasquez] What is this all about?

[Vasquez] You keep saying "accident," \ "accident"...

[Vasquez] How are you so sure?

[Phoenix] What do you mean?

[Vasquez] Must I spell everything \ out for you?

[Vasquez] Think: what would it be \ if it wasn't an accident?

[Phoenix] ...!

[Phoenix] No...

[Phoenix] No way!

[Phoenix] You mean Mr. Hammer \ did it... on purpose?

[Vasquez] That is what I mean.

[Phoenix] Wh-where's your proof! \ Can you prove it!?

[Vasquez] Hmph!

[Vasquez] Just think!

[Vasquez] Would he have let me run \ his life for five years... \ over a mere accident?

[Vasquez] And I ran him hard, \ believe you me!

[Maya] B-but, the security lady \ said it was an accident!

[Vasquez] Oh. Well, she was a big \ fan of Hammer's, you see.

[Vasquez] She jumped on the reporter \ who brought that photo \ into the studio.

[Vasquez] She wrenched it out of his \ hands, she did. Gave him a \ few bruises, too.

[Phoenix] (...)

[Phoenix] (So that's why she \ had the photo...)

[Vasquez] She's an old fool.

[Vasquez] Of course, all the reporter \ would need is the negatives. \ He could have made a copy.

[Vasquez] But he didn't.

[Vasquez] The only copy of that photo \ is the one you hold.

[Vasquez] Give it to me. Now.

[Maya] W-what? This is valuable \ evidence!

[Vasquez] Boys!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] U-umm...

[Phoenix] Who are they...?

[Vasquez] Professionals.

[Vasquez] They're good at erasing... \ various things.

[Vasquez] What do you think...? \ Would you like to be erased?

[Phoenix] Wh-what!?

[Vasquez] The trial ends tomorrow?

[Vasquez] How unfortunate.

[Vasquez] It's a shame you'll \ have to miss it!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Tell me why.

[Phoenix] Why do you want this \ photograph so badly?

[Phoenix] This is Mr. Hammer's \ "dirt"... no?

[Phoenix] Why should Dee Vasquez \ care about it at all?

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] I'm sure you'll have plenty \ of time to think about that \ where you're going.

[Vasquez] So long, friends.

[Vasquez] Boys, erase away.

[Gumshoe] Sorry I was a little late \ with my entrance.

[Gumshoe] I don't get many chances to \ practice that sorta thing.

[Maya] Detective Gumshoe...

[Maya] Thank you thank you thank you!

[Maya] I was really scared...

[Gumshoe] Huh? \ Don't mention it, pal. \ Just doing my job.

[Gumshoe] ...

[Maya] Detective Gumshoe?

[Gumshoe] Sorry, it's just... I've \ wanted to say that line ever \ since I became a detective.

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] Okay. I've got one more \ job to do today.

[Gumshoe] I'm sure we'll run into \ each other again soon!

[] ...

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green October 20, 10:00 AM \ District Court \ Courtroom No. 4

[Judge] Court is now in session for \ the trial of Mr. Will Powers.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution is ready, \ Your Honor.

[Phoenix] The defense is ready, \ Your Honor.

[Judge] Today will be the final \ day of this trial.

[Judge] I hope both the prosecution \ and the defense will be able \ to present decisive evidence.

[Judge] Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. \ Your opening statement.

[Edgeworth] In yesterday's session, the \ defense presented us with \ a new theory for this case.

[Edgeworth] He claims that the scene \ of the crime was, in fact, \ Studio Two.

[Edgeworth] Today, I will call on people \ present in the Studio Two \ trailer that day.

[Edgeworth] From their testimonies, the \ truth will become clear.

[Judge] Hmm... very well!

[Phoenix] (Edgeworth seems a bit \ on edge today...)

[Judge] You may call your first \ witness, Mr. Edgeworth.

[Edgeworth] The prosecution calls Ms. \ Dee Vasquez to the stand.

[Edgeworth] Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer \ who was present in the Studio \ Two trailer that day.

[] ...

[Edgeworth] Will the witness state her \ name and occupation?

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] Dee Vasquez. \ I am a producer for \ Global Studios.

[Edgeworth] On the day of the murder, \ you were in the trailer in \ Studio Two...

[Vasquez] As everyone here knows, \ yes?

[Edgeworth] ...?

[Vasquez] I dislike needless banter.

[Vasquez] If you must pontificate, do \ it when I'm not here.

[Edgeworth] Mrrph!

[Judge] V-very well, Ms. Vasquez.

[Judge] Please give the court your \ testimony concerning the \ day of the murder.

[Maya] Nick! I know she did it! \ Make her pay!

[Phoenix] R-right!

[Phoenx] (If she's guilty, I'll \ catch her with her pants \ down... So to speak.)

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- The Day of the Murder --

[Vasquez] (1) \ I entered the trailer, oh, \ a little before noon.

[Vasquez] (2) \ The meeting began at 12:00 \ sharp. It ended at 4:00.

[Vasquez] (3) \ There was to be a rehearsal \ afterwards, so we went to \ Studio One...

[Vasquez] (4) \ I was fatigued, so I \ had Sal take me.

[Vasquez] (5) \ At 2:30, we took a 15-minute \ break in the meeting.

[Vasquez] (6) \ Sal and I ate t-bone steaks \ on the table in front of the \ trailer.

[Vasquez] We found Hammer's body \ later, when we all went \ to Studio One.

[Vasquez] That's all.

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] I have a question about \ one part of your testimony.

[Judge] You were "fatigued" so you \ had Sal "take" you...?

[Vasquez] The van.

[Judge] Hmm?

[Vasquez] There's a van at Studio Two.

[Vasquez] I had him take me in that.

[Vasquez] I thought it might be risky \ to walk, what with that \ monkey's head toppling over.

[] Van added to the \ Court Record.

[Judge] I... I see!

[Judge] Very well. Mr. Wright, \ your cross-examination.

[Maya] This is the final battle, \ Nick! Let's do it!

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- The Day of the Murder --

[Vasquez] (1) \ I entered the trailer, oh, \ a little before noon.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] By yourself?

[Vasquez] Yes.

[Phoenix] And you didn't stop in \ at the Employee Area?

[Vasquez] No.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Are you always this... terse?

[Vasquez] Yes.

[Phoenix] (Oh dear...)

[Vasquez] (2) \ The meeting began at 12:00 \ sharp. It ended at 4:00.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Did no one leave during \ the meeting?

[Vasquez] No one.

[Vasquez] ...

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] C-come on... let's talk \ a bit more about that.

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] The witness did not come \ here to engage in idle \ conversation!

[Edgeworth] Stop interrupting the \ testimony.

[Vasquez] The same could be said to \ you, Mr. Edgeworth.

[Vasquez] And please stop banging \ on your little desk. It \ hurts my ears.

[Edgeworth] Mmph!

[Vasquez] (3) \ There was to be a rehearsal \ afterwards, so we went to \ Studio One...

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] And when exactly was that?

[Vasquez] I've forgotten.

[Phoenix] ...

[Vasquez] ...

[Phoenix] Maybe you could try \ remembering?

[Vasquez] No.

[Edgeworth] The meeting ended at 4:00, \ and the rehearsal was \ scheduled for 5:00...

[Edgeworth] I would think it was \ between those times.

[Phoenix] (You "would think"!? C'mon, \ all you did was state the \ obvious, Edgeworth!)

[Vasquez] (4) \ I was fatigued, so I \ had Sal take me.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Hold on!

[Phoenix] You had Sal "take" you? \ What does that mean!?

[Vasquez] It means what I just said.

[Vasquez] I had Sal take me in \ the Studio Two van.

[Phoenix] (Oh... oh, right.)

[Vasquez] (5) \ At 2:30, we took a 15-minute \ break in the meeting.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] And what were you doing \ during that time...?

[Vasquez] Don't hit your desk.

[Vasquez] It irritates me.

[Edgeworth] Yeah! Mr. Wright...!

[Edgeworth] Oops.

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] It was a 15 minute break...

[Vasquez] (6) \ Sal and I ate t-bone steaks \ on the table in front of the \ trailer.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Do you have someone who \ can verify this?

[Vasquez] Sal.

[Phoenix] N-no... \ I mean someone else?

[Vasquez] One person is enough.

[Phoenix] (If she committed murder \ during that break...)

[Phoenix] (She wouldn't have had time \ to eat a t-bone steak!)

[Phoenix] (If I had some evidence that \ proved she didn't eat that \ steak...)

[Maya] Well, Nick? Find anything?

[Phoenix] I kind of wish she'd \ said a little more...

[Maya] It's hard. I think she's \ pretty used to being the boss.

[Maya] But I'm sure you'll find some \ kind of contradiction in what \ she said... somewhere!

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Hah! As I thought!

[Vasquez] ...

[Phoenix] You claim you ate a t-bone \ steak!

[Phoenix] But I say you did not!

[Judge] W-what's this, now, \ Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Look at this.

[Judge] It's... a plate?

[Phoenix] This plate was on the table \ in the employee room.

[Phoenix] As you can see, a large \ bone has been left behind.

[Edgeworth] Mr. Wright. Need I remind \ you it was a T-BONE STEAK!?

[Phoenix] Exactly my point!

[Phoenix] Remember, if you will...

[Phoenix] Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Manella \ ate at a table outside the \ trailer.

[Phoenx] Yet there were no bones left \ on the plates!

[Phoenix] The plates were bare!

[Vasquez] !

[Phoenix] Ms. Vasquez?

[Phoenix] Tell me, how can a person \ eat a t-bone steak...

[Phoenix] and not leave the bone?

[Phoenix] I think I know how!

***You ate the bone, too********************

[Phoenix] You ate the bone, too!

[Maya] Um, Nick... are you sure?

[Maya] I mean, I love steak, but \ even I don't eat the bone!

[Phoenix] Hey, I don't eat it either!

[Judge] Mr. Wright!

[Judge] I, too, leave the bone.

[Phoenix] Um, can I try that again?

[] RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

***You ate a boneless steak*****************

[Phoenix] Elementary! You were eating \ a boneless steak!

[Judge] ...

[Judge] Mr. Wright, say you \ are right...

[Judge] What would that prove?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Um, right, Your Honor.

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] Remember her testimony?

[Vasquez] She said she ate a "t-bone \ steak"!

[Maya] She said "bone"!

[Phoenix] Correct! \ I was... testing you!

[Maya] Yeah, sure, Nick.

[Phoenix] Sorry... \ Can I try that one more time?

[Judge] ...

***You didn't eat the steak*****************

[Phoenix] You didn't eat any steak \ during that break!

[Phoenix] Isn't it obvious, Your Honor?

***Picking on Sal Manella*******************

[Judge] Sometimes this court finds it \ hard to tell whether you are \ joking or being serious.

[Phoenix] Oh...?

[Judge] I would prefer it if you \ remained serious!

[Phoenix] Y-yes, Your Honor. \ I'll do my best.

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] She was meeting with \ the Steel Samurai!

[Judge] A-are you saying...!?

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor!

[Phoenix] As Ms. Vasquez left the \ trailer to eat her steak...

[Phoenix] She ran into the \ Steel Samurai!

[Phoenix] And then you did it.

[Phoenix] You killed him with \ your own hands!

[Vasquez] !!!

[Judge] M-Mr. Wright!

[Judge] I-isn't that a little \ presumptuous!?

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] What kind of stunt are you \ trying to pull, Wright!?

[Vasquez] Let him claim what he wants...

[Vasquez] You say I did it?

[Phoenix] Yes.

[Vasquez] Fascinating!

[Vasquez] And here I was worrying that \ today would be as boring \ as all the rest.

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] Very well.

[Vasquez] Let us have a battle \ of wits, you and I.

[Phoenix] (Any day, Vasquez!)

[Maya] Good luck, Nick!

[Vasquez] Let's see...

[Vasquez] What was that murder weapon \ again? Oh yes, the "Samurai \ Spear."

[Phoenix] Yes...?

[Vasquez] I am, as you can see, \ a woman of petite stature.

[Vasquez] How could I possibly use that \ heavy spear as a weapon?

***I think you could!***********************

[Phoenix] It's not impossible!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Well, maybe it's not \ impossible, but--

[Vasquez] Silence.

[Vasquez] I'm speaking.

[Edgeworth] Mmmph!

[Vasquez] The victim was stabbed \ through the chest from \ the front, yes?

[Vasquez] I believe this would indicate \ that the victim was aware of \ the killer's presence.

[Vasquez] Now, the Steel Samurai \ costume is quite light \ and mobile.

[Vasquez] Compared to the victim, I am \ weaker and slower...

[Vasquez] I couldn't possibly \ win such a fight!

[Vasquez] Not to mention, there is \ proof I did not have the \ spear!

[Vasquez] The photograph of the Steel \ Samurai shows that the victim \ himself was holding it!

[Vasquez] Or do you mean to suggest \ that I could have wrested \ it away from him?

[Edgeworth] Y-yeah! Take that, Wright!

[Edgeworth] If you still think she did \ it, show us proof!

[Phoenix] Umm... er...

[Maya] Hey, Nick.

[Maya] Look at the data we have \ on that Samurai Spear in \ the Court Record.

[Maya] Isn't there something in \ there that gets to you...?

[Phoenix] Something odd about the \ Samurai Spear...?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Wait!

[Judge] Something the matter, \ Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] S-sorry, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] I'd like to take back \ my previous claim.

[Judge] Very well, I won't hold \ you to your claim.

[Judge] But I'm afraid I will have \ to penalize you.

[Phoenix] (Ugh...)

[Edgeworth] What's this? \ You're taking back your claim?

[Phoenix] Let's backtrack for \ a moment.

[Phoenix] I want to consider whether \ the witness could have used \ the Samurai Spear or not!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***You couldn't, could you******************

[Phoenix] I think you would have \ a great deal of difficulty \ using that as a weapon.

[Phoenix] Pretty much anyone would.

[Vasquez] Hah.

[Vasquez] You see?

[Phoenix] Yes...

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***I don't know*****************************

[Phoenix] I don't know.

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] You "don't know"!? \ What kind of a lawyer \ are you!?

[Vasquez] Quiet. I'm speaking.

[Edgeworth] M-m-mmph!

[Vasquez] You "don't know"!? \ What kind of a lawyer...

[Phoenix] I don't know whether \ you could have fought \ with the Samurai Spear...

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] However, that has no \ bearing on this case!

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] Meaning?

[Phoenix] The Samurai Spear was \ not the murder weapon!

[Vasquez] What!?

[Judge] What is the meaning of this!?

[Judge] The spear was found lying \ next to the victim's body!

[Phoenix] I have proof, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] I can prove that the \ Samurai Spear was not \ used as the murder weapon!

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Judge] Wrong, Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] But I haven't said \ anything yet...?

[Judge] I know you well enough by now \ to know when you're going to \ present the wrong evidence.

[Maya] I can sense it too, with \ my Fey blood...

[Phoenix] (Okay, okay, so I picked the \ wrong evidence! Enough with \ all the sensing!)

[Phoenix] Right. \ Okay, here's the real \ evidence, Your Honor.

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] I present my proof: the \ so-called "murder weapon"!

[Edgeworth] B-but, that IS the \ murder weapon!

[Phoenix] Not so fast.

[Phoenix] Remember that this spear \ broke during the morning \ action scene run-through?

[Phoenix] But, someone fixed the \ spear.

[Phoenix] It was the security lady!

[Phoenix] She fixed it with duct tape!

[Phoenix] Now tell me, how is it \ possible...

[Phoenix] for someone to stab a man \ who is wearing a thick costume \ with this!? Through the chest!

[Judge] O-order! Order!

[Edgeworth] Mr. Wright! What are you \ driving at!?

[Edgeworth] Think about what you're--

[Vasquez] Silence!

[Vasquez] I'm the one testifying here \ and I will be heard!

[Edgeworth] Mmmph...!

[Vasquez] Are you quite sane?

[Vasquez] Are you even aware of what \ you're saying?

[Vasquez] If the Samurai Spear was \ not the murder weapon, \ then pray tell what was!?

[Vasquez] How was Hammer killed?

[Judge] Well, Mr. Wright? Can you \ tell us what weapon was \ used to kill Mr. Hammer?

***I can tell you***************************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***I can't tell you*************************

[Phoenix] Of course I can't.

[Judge] "O-of course"!?

[Edgeworth] Can the antics, Wright!

[Judge] I have to agree, Mr. Wright. \ At least pretend that you \ think you might know!

[Phoenix] (Urk. Note to self: think \ before speaking.)

[Phoenix] (Tough crowd...)

[] RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

[Phoenix] Would I make a claim like \ that if I couldn't tell you \ what the weapon was?

[Judge] I'm afraid your confidence \ can sometimes be unfounded, \ Mr. Wright...

[Judge] Very well, let's see this \ murder weapon, then.

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] Think about this some \ more!

[Phoenix] Huh? Think?

[Maya] Please!

[Maya] How could that possibly \ have been the murder weapon!?

[Phoenix] (Hmm. She has a point.)

[Judge] Something the matter?

[Phoenix] N-no, Your Honor. \ Nothing!

[] RETURN TO COURT RECORD

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] Look at this photo.

[Judge] W-what is this?

[Judge] Why, that's Jack Hammer \ standing at the top of \ the stairs!

[Judge] O-order! Order!

[Judge] If I cannot have order this \ trial will be suspended!

[Judge] Mr. Wright!

[Judge] What is this all about!?

[Phoenix] This photograph is from \ five years ago.

[Phoenix] There was an unfortunate \ accident at Global Studios.

[Phoenix] This is a photo of that \ very accident.

[Phoenix] Not a word of this was \ leaked to the outside.

[Phoenix] It was a close-kept \ secret at the studios.

[Edgeworth] What does this have to \ do with the currect case!?

[Phoenix] Mr. Edgeworth...

[Phoenix] You still can't see it?

[Phoenix] See the fallen man in this \ photo? See how the fencepost \ pierced him through the chest?

[Edgeworth] Wh... what!?

[Edgeworth] Are you saying...!?

[Phoenix] Yes.

[Phoenix] What happened five years \ ago...

[Phoenix] has happened again!

[Vasquez] !!!

[Judge] Mr. Wright! \ Continue!

[Phoenix] It's 2:30 PM on the day \ of the murder!

[Phoenix] Ms. Dee Vasquez meets \ Jack Hammer outside \ the Studio Two trailer!

[Phoenix] Then she did it!

[Phoenix] She pushed Mr. Hammer off \ the stairs onto the fence!

[Phoenix] Just like Mr. Hammer had \ himself done five years ago!

[Phoenix] Though whether she did it \ on purpose or by accident, \ I cannot say.

[Vasquez] ...!

[Edgeworth] I-in other words... \ th-the victim, Mr. Hammer...

[Edgeworth] He died in the same way \ that he caused another \ man to die...

[Edgeworth] five years ago!

[Phoenix] Precisely.

[Phoenix] Ironic, isn't it?

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] Hoh hoh. \ Very creative, Mr. Wright.

[Vasquez] I could use a man like you \ on my script writing staff.

[Phoenix] You deny that what \ I say is true?

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] Mr. Wright.

[Vasquez] Let's say, for the sake of \ argument, that Hammer died \ at the trailer as you say.

[Vasquez] Yet, the body was found \ at Studio One, was it not?

[Vasquez] And in the Evil Magistrate's \ costume, no less.

[Vasquez] Are you then claiming that \ I carried the body to \ Studio One...

[Vasquez] And returned to the trailer, \ all in the space of \ a 15 minute break?

[Vasquez] How could I have \ disposed of the body!?

[Phoenix] ...

[Edgeworth] The break in the meeting \ at the trailer lasted 15 \ minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45.

[Edgeworth] Could Jack Hammer have been \ pushed off the stairs to \ his death...

[Edgeworth] then carried to Studio One \ and placed inside his \ costume?

[Edgeworth] There wasn't enough time!

[Judge] Hmm... indeed.

[Judge] Well, Mr. Wright? \ How could she have dealt \ with the body?

***She couldn't deal with it****************

[Phoenix] 15 minutes is kind of \ a short amount of time...

[Vasquez] You see?

[Vasquez] Even I cannot do \ the impossible.

[Vasquez] Therefore, Mr. Wright.

[Vasquez] I didn't do it. \ Agreed?

[Phoenix] Not agreed!

[Vasquez] ?

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***I bet she could move it******************

[Phoenix] You'd be surprised! \ I bet she could do it!

[Phoenix] When people think their \ life depends on it, they \ can do amazing things!

[Judge] Mr. Wright, this is not \ an episode of "That's \ Incredible."

[Edgeworth] If you claim she did \ everything in 15 minutes...

[Phoenix] (Let me guess: \ "Show Me Proof!")

[Edgeworth] Correct! \ Show me proof!

[Phoenix] (How am I supposed to \ do that...?)

[Edgeworth] Then I won't have you making \ unsubstantiated claims!

[Phoenix] (...)

[Phoenix] (Wait a second, how does \ he know what I'm thinking!?)

[Edgeworth] Hah!

[Edgeworth] I need only look at the cold \ sweat running down your face \ to know what you're thinking!

[Judge] Mr. Wright. Perhaps you'd \ like to reconsider your claim?

[] RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

***She had another way**********************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] What if she had another way \ to carry the body, other than \ with her own hands?

[Vasquez] For instance?

[Phoenix] Actually, for that matter, \ there was no need for her \ to do the deed in 15 minutes!

[Phoenix] And there was a way for \ you to carry that body.

[Vasquez] !!!

[Vasquez] I-interesting! \ Let's hear it then.

[Judge] Mr. Wright?

[Judge] Please show us how \ she carried the body.

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] Dee Vasquez used this to \ carry the body to Studio One!

[Vasquez] ...

[Judge] Mr. Wright...

[Phoenix] Your Honor?

[Judge] Mr. Wright, how can you \ carry a dead body with that?

[Phoenix] Umm...

[Judge] Please rethink your statement.

[] RETURN TO COURT RECORD

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] Ms. Vasquez.

[Phoenix] You carried the body \ to Studio One.

[Phoenix] And you used the studio \ van to do it!

[Vasquez] !!!

[Phoenix] Recall your testimony...

[Vasquez] There was to be a rehearsal \ afterwards, so we went to \ Studio One.

[Vasquez] I was fatigued, \ so I had Sal take me.

[Vasquez] There was a van there, right? \ I had Sal drive me.

[Phoenix] You used the van to carry \ the body to Studio One!

[Phoenix] Then, before everyone else \ got there, you put the body \ into the Magistrate costume!

[Vasquez] ...!

[Edgeworth] *OBJECTION!*

[Edgeworth] Hold on, Wright!

[Edgeworth] Don't forget, it was Sal \ Manella that drove the van!

[Edgeworth] Are you suggesting that \ Mr. Manella was a conspirator?

***Of course he was*************************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Of course he wasn't**********************

[Phoenix] Of course he wasn't!

[Edgeworth] Hah!

[Edgeworth] So, without Mr. Manella \ noticing anything, she put \ the body in the van...

[Edgeworth] Then managed to put the body \ into the costume...?

[Edgeworth] Are you seriously suggesting \ that is possible!?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Of course I'm not serious.

[Edgeworth] Ha... hah!?

[Phoenix] I was kidding. To, er, \ lighten up the proceedings.

[Edgeworth] Li..light...

[Edgeworth] Lighten!? \ Y-you can't lighten up \ a murder!

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Judge] The court requests you refrain \ from making claims in jest.

[Phoenix] Y-yes, Your Honor.

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] Of course, Sal Manella has \ to have been a conspirator!

[Phoenix] The body had to be placed in \ the van, and put into the \ costume.

[Phoenix] There's no way Ms. Vasquez \ could have done that alone!

[Phoenix] Also, don't forget that \ they had to dispose of the \ Steel Samurai costume.

[Phoenix] They had to... because it \ was covered in Mr. Hammer's \ blood!

[Phoenix] They probably burned it \ in that small incinerator.

[Phoenix] Well, Ms. Vasquez!

[Phoenix] Shall I continue?

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] No need.

[Vasquez] You're smarter than \ you look, Mr. Wright.

[Vasquez] Hmph.

[Vasquez] I lose. You win. \ It... was fun.

[Phoenix] (I... win!?)

[Phoenix] ...

[Edgeworth] ...

[Judge] ...

[] ...

[] ...

[Phoenix] Umm...

[Phoenix] So... what happens next?

[Vasquez] ?

[Phoenix] Don't "?" me!

[Phoenix] Don't you have anything \ to say!?

[Vasquez] What would you like me to say?

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Phoenix] "I lost"? \ Something like that!

[Vasquez] I just said that.

[Phoenix] W-wait, so you mean...

[Phoenix] Dee Vasquez! \ So, it was you?

[Phoenix] You killed Jack Hammer!

[Phoenix] ...

[Edgeworth] ...

[Judge] ...

[] ...

[] ...

[Vasquez] Who can say?

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Vasquez] Are you sure I did?

[Vasquez] Mr. Wright...

[Vasquez] We just engaged in \ a battle of wits.

[Vasquez] And the result of that battle? \ You proved the possibility \ that I murdered Hammer.

[Phoenix] R-right!

[Vasquez] But... that is only \ a possibility.

[Vasquez] Proof is another thing \ altogether.

[Vasquez] You lack decisive proof, \ Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] Wha... wha... wha... wha...

[Phoenix] WHAAAAAAAAAT!?

[Judge] Order!

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth, \ your thoughts?

[Edgeworth] Umm... uhh... mmmph.

[Edgeworth] O-of course, it's as \ the witness says!

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Certainly, it does seem very \ likely she did it... but, uh, \ there's no proof!

[Phoenix] (...!)

[Phoenix] (Edgeworth isn't sure!)

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] Well?

[Vasquez] I came here was a witness \ today.

[Vasquez] If you've no more questions, \ I'll be leaving.

[Phoenix] (Urk! What do I do now!?)

***You did it, Vasquez!*********************

[Phoenix] Ms. Vasquez! \ You did it!

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] That wasn't a question.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Um, did you do it?

[Vasquez] No.

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] Y-yes, Your Honor?

[Judge] I'm not sure that question \ helped the court get any \ closer to a verdict.

***Testify again, Vasquez!******************

[Vasquez] Know when to give up, \ Mr. Wright.

[Vasquez] Think about it.

[Vasquez] Even if I were to testify \ again, what's the point?

[Vasquez] I can only say what I said \ before. The truth, Mr. Wright.

[Vasquez] I've already said all \ there is to say.

[Vasquez] What would happen if \ I said it again?

[Phoenix] Uh...

[Vasquez] You'd ask the same questions, \ get the same answers.

[Edgeworth] Your Honor!

[Edgeworth] I request that the \ witness testify again!

[Vasquez] You are the prosecutor, \ are you not?

[Vasquez] Why are you badgering me? \ I'm your witness!

[Edgeworth] I... I just want to hear \ your testimony again.

[Vasquez] Does this make any sense \ to you, Your Honor?

[Vasquez] I don't see that we have \ anything to gain by repeating \ the last several minutes.

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth...

[Judge] I, too, see little point in \ making Ms. Vasquez repeat \ herself.

[Judge] What exactly did you want \ her to testify about?

[Edgeworth] Mmmph! Well, yes, um...

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Indeed! \ Verily, I say... \ Ergo!

[Edgeworth] I want to hear about what \ happened... after they found \ the body!

[Judge] After they found the body...?

[Judge] Very well.

[Judge] The witness will testify \ to the court concerning \ this matter.

[Vasquez] Hmph.

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] Why did Edgeworth...?

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- After Finding the Body --

[Vasquez] (3) \ I immediately called the \ police. Then Powers showed \ up.

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- After Finding the Body --

[Vasquez] (1) \ I was with Sal and Oldbag, \ the security lady, when we \ found the body.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What time was that?

[Vasquez] We were to meet at 5:00 \ for the rehearsal.

[Vasquez] So I'd say it was then.

[Phoenix] When exactly did you \ and Mr. Manella arrive \ at the studio?

[Vasquez] About 10 minutes before.

[Vasquez] I wasn't stuffing any bodies \ into costumes, mind you.

[Phoenix] (Hmm...)

***Press harder*****************************

[Phoenix] Where were the other employees \ when you got to the studio?

[Vasquez] They weren't there yet.

[Phoenix] Well!?

[Phoenix] Then you could have put \ Hammer in that costume, \ with Sal Manella's help!

[Vasquez] Oh?

[Vasquez] What did I just say?

[Vasquez] Did I not just say "I wasn't \ stuffing any bodies into \ any costumes"...?

[Vasquez] You should try to listen \ to what people are saying, \ boy.

[Phoenix] (B-boy!?)

[Judge] The witness will continue \ her testimony.

********************************************

***Hold back********************************

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Mr. Powers was taking \ a nap, correct?

[Vasquez] So he says.

[Phoenix] Did no one go to call him?

[Vasquez] Remember...

[Phoenix] Remember... what?

[Vasquez] There was a dead body lying \ in front of us. Yet you \ expect me to be calm?

[Phoenix] (You certainly seemed \ calm enough when I accused \ you of murder!)

[Phoenix] (*sigh*)

***Press harder*****************************

[Phoenix] Wait a second! \ Wouldn't that be the \ other way around!?

[Vasquez] The other way around?

[Phoenix] You discovered a murdered \ body, and one person was \ missing, right?

[Phoenix] Wouldn't you normally go \ looking for the missing \ person!?

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] I have to agree with \ the defense on this one.

[Judge] Well, Ms. Vasquez?

[Vasquez] Hmph.

[Vasquez] Logically speaking, perhaps.

[Vasquez] But no one there was thinking \ very logically, I assure you.

[Vasquez] Also.

[Vasquez] Without his Steel Samurai \ costume, Powers doesn't really \ stand out.

[Vasquez] We often left him on the \ bus when shooting at location. \ No one noticed he was missing.

[Phoenix] (Poor Powers...)

[Judge] Hmm... \ Well, I suppose that \ explains that.

[Judge] Very well, Ms. Vasquez. \ You may continue.

[Phoenix] What was everyone else \ doing at that time?

[Vasquez] No one said a thing.

[Vasquez] So we stood there until Powers \ finally arrived on the scene.

[Vasquez] "Sorry! Sorry I'm late!"

[Vasquez] Then... silence. \ Dead silence.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] (Oldbag... the security lady.)

[Phoenix] Why did the security lady \ think Powers had done it?

[Vasquez] She said because she saw \ him going toward the studio.

[Phoenix] (Right... the Steel Samurai.)

***Press harder*****************************

[Phoenix] Did the detective arrest \ Mr. Powers based solely on \ the security lady's word?

[Vasquez] Perhaps not.

[Vasquez] It seems that everyone \ else was questioned.

[Vasquez] And I'm really not fond \ of that sort of thing.

[Phoenix] But, you can't just decide \ who the police will and \ won't question!

[Vasquez] Thankfully, the studio \ thinks otherwise.

[Vasquez] They were nice enough to \ understand that, since we \ were in a meeting...

[Vasquez] There was no way we could \ have been involved. Thus, \ they covered for us.

[Phoenix] (Covered for you... \ or covered it up for you?)

[Phoenix] (There must have been a lot \ riding on it, with all those \ bigwigs at the meeting...)

[Phoenix] (I'm sure her "professionals" \ helped convince everyone they \ didn't require questioning.

[Vasquez] (6) \ I went back to the trailer \ to get my script and direction \ notes.

[Phoenix] The script and your \ direction notes?

[Vasquez] Yes, they're quite \ valuable. It wouldn't \ do to have them stolen.

[Edgeworth] Ms. Vasquez said she didn't \ bring the script because there \ wouldn't be a rehearsal.

[Edgeworth] Don't you see what \ that means?

[Vasquez] ...!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth!

[Edgeworth] ...

[Judge] What you have just said...

[Judge] is a reasonable observation.

[Judge] However, I find it hard to \ understand why the prosecution \ would make such a move!

[Judge] Or are you thinking of a \ career change to defense!?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] I... appreciate the concern, \ Your Honor.

[Edgeworth] I will stand by my statement, \ however, regardless of how \ the court sees my role here.

[Edgeworth] Now, Ms. Vasquez...

[Edgeworth] Do you have an explanation?

[Phoenix] (I can't believe Edgeworth \ is helping me!)

[Vasquez] Hmph.

[Vasquez] So the prosecution is in \ cahoots with the defense? \ What kind of court is this?

[Vasquez] No matter.

[Vasquez] I think you misunderstood me.

[Vasquez] (7b) \ I knew that Hammer was injured \ and couldn't do any action \ scenes, so I left them behind.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] How did you know about \ the injury?

[Vasquez] H-how did I know!?

[Vasquez] Sal.

[Vasquez] He told me.

[Phoenix] (Sal the director... \ Hmm...)

[Maya] You have to find something \ to peg this on her here...

[Maya] Or everything we've done \ till now will have been \ wasted!

[Maya] I believe in you, Nick! \ Go get 'em!

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] You "knew that Hammer \ was injured"...?

[Phoenix] Don't you think that's \ a little funny?

[Phoenix] I mean, it was the Steel \ Samurai who was injured!

[Pheonix] It was Will Powers!

[Vasquez] Wh... what!?

[Judge] Mr. Wright! \ Explain yourself!

[Phoenix] Yes, Mr. Hammer is dragging \ his leg in this photo.

[Phoenix] But that's because he was \ pretending to be Mr. Powers!

[Vasquez] P-pretending...?

[Phoenix] One person was injured in the \ run-through that morning.

[Phoenix] That person was Mr. Powers, \ not Mr. Hammer!

[Phoenix] Now, why did you think it was \ Mr. Hammer who was injured?

[Vasquez] ...!

[Vasquez] I-I already said it \ was Sal who told me!

[Vasquez] Th-that's right! \ He must have gotten it wrong.

[Phoenix] I think not.

[Phoenix] Mr. Manella was at the \ run-through that morning.

[Phoenix] He would have known it was \ Mr. Powers who was injured. \ He saw it happen!

[Phoenix] Why would he tell you \ the wrong person?

[Phoenix] Ms. Vasquez!

***You heard Mr. Manella wrong**************

[Phoenix] You must have heard \ Mr. Manella wrong!

[Phoenix] Even though he said \ Mr. Powers was injured...

[Phoenix] You thought he was talking \ about Mr. Hammer!

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] Now that you mention it...

[Vasquez] Yes, I believe you're right.

[Vasquez] I'm sure that's what happened.

[Phoenix] Yeah!

[Phoenix] ...

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] You're supposed to be putting \ her on the spot, not helping \ her out!

[Phoenix] Oh, right... \ I kind of talked myself out \ of that one, didn't I?

[Maya] Quick! Start over!

********************************************

[Phoenix] Actually, you didn't hear \ anything from Mr. Manella.

[Phoenix] You saw Mr. Hammer limping \ with your own eyes!

[Judge] Yes, but...

[Judge] Wasn't it Mr. Powers who \ was injured...?

[Phoenix] Yes, but remember!

[Phoenix] Mr. Hammer was dragging \ his leg, too!

[Phoenix] He was pretending to be \ Mr. Powers!

[Judge] Aah!

[Phoenix] And when was he \ doing this...?

[Edgeworth] Well...

[Edgeworth] It would have been after he \ put on the Steel Samurai \ costume...

[Edgeworth] and went to Studio Two. \ Where he was murdered!

[Phoenix] Exactly!

[Phoenix] Ms. Vasquez!

[Phoenix] You met him, didn't you? \ You saw the Steel Samurai \ limping!

[Phoenix] And Mr. Hammer was in \ that Steel Samurai suit!

[Phoenix] That's why you were confused!

[Phoenix] That's why you thought it \ was Mr. Hammer who had been \ injured that morning!

[Vasquez] ...!!!

[Judge] Order! Order! \ I will have order!

[Edgeworth] Witness!

[Edgeworth] Can you refute this claim?

[Vasquez] Hrrmmmmm... hmph!

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] ...

[Phoenix] (Yeah, let's see you sneak \ out of this one, Vasquez!)

[Vasquez] ...

[Vasquez] Very well!

[Vasquez] I have a question for you!

[Phoenix] (Urk...)

[Phoenix] (Why are the real killers \ always so... persistent?)

[Vasquez] Why in the world would \ I want Mr. Hammer dead?

[Vasquez] Yes, he'd fallen on hard \ times, but he was a star!

[Vasquez] I had nothing to gain \ from his death! Nothing!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Yes, you would need a motive.

[Jude] Why would she have killed \ the victim?

[Judge] If there is a reason, \ it is unclear to this court.

[Judge] Does the defense have anything \ to say on the matter?

[Judge] In other words, can you \ prove she had a motive?

***Of course I can prove it!****************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Of course I can't prove it!**************

[Maya] Nick, no!

[Maya] Saying you can't prove it \ now would be admitting \ defeat!

[Maya] She'll get away!

[Phoenix] But... but what proof \ could I possibly have!?

[Maya] I don't care if it's \ impossible, you still \ have to fight this one!

[Phoenix] Ugh...

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] Okay.

[Phoenix] I have proof, and \ I'll show it to you!

[Phoenix] I present to the court \ evidence as to Ms. Vasquez's \ motive in this murder.

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] Psst, Maya, look. \ This is it.

[Maya] ...!

[Maya] Why... are you showing \ that to me, Nick?

[Maya] And why are you whispering?

[Phoenix] I was just testing it \ out on you.

[Maya] Huh.

[Maya] Well, I'm afraid your \ test results are negative.

[Judge] Mr. Wright!

[Phoenix] Y-yes, Your Honor!

[Judge] Hurry up with it!

[Judge] We have a certain tempo \ we have to maintain here!

[Phoenix] Yes... yes, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] Right. Here goes!

[] RETURN TO COURT RECORD

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] This is my proof!

[Judge] This is... the photo \ from before?

[Phoenix] This photo reveals the \ motive in this murder!

[Vasquez] ...!

[Pheonix] I'm right, aren't I, \ Ms. Vasquez?

[Vasquez] Hrrrrrrm... hmph!

[Phoenix] Five years ago, Mr. Hammer \ was at the height of his fame.

[Phoenix] With Dee Vasquez's help, a \ terrible accident was swept \ under the carpet...

[Phoenix] Ladies and gentlemen, \ the case currently up \ for trial...

[Phoenix] It began on that day, \ five years ago!

[Vasquez] ...

[Phoenix] Ironically enough, that \ accident precipitated \ Mr. Hammer's fall...

[Phoenix] His fall from stardom!

[Edgeworth] His guilt weighed him \ down, no doubt.

[Phoenix] However!

[Phoenix] You, Dee Vasquez, used \ Mr. Hammer.

[Phoenix] You made him work for you \ for petty change!

[Vasquez] Hmph.

[Edgeworth] Bringing us to the present \ day... and Mr. Hammer's last \ role as the Evil Magistrate!

[Phoenix] Yes! Undoubtedly, it was \ a constant source of shame \ for the ex-star...

[Edgeworth] Hmm...

[Judge] One moment, Mr. Wright.

[Judge] We are talking about motives, \ here... yet you have only \ talked about Mr. Hammer.

[Judge] It almost seems as if...

[Judge] As if it was Mr. Hammer who \ had killed Dee Vasquez, not \ the other way around!

[Judge] What motive would Ms. Vasquez \ have?

[Vasquez] Y-yes, that's right.

[Vasquez] According to what you say...

[Vasquez] I would have had no reason to \ kill Hammer. He was a good \ source of income for me!

[Vasquez] And I never get rid of useful \ men. It's a policy of mine.

[Judge] Mr. Wright?

[Judge] Please explain Ms. Vasquez's \ motive for murder.

***Reveal evidence**************************

[Phoenix] Okay...

[Phoenix] Allow me to present to the \ court evidence proving \ Ms. Vasquez's motive!

***Present anything*************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * This is my proof!

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Urk!)

***She had no motive************************

********************************************

[Phoenix] She had no motive, Your Honor.

[Judge] What's that now!?

[Phoenix] It was Mr. Hammer who was \ out for blood!

[Phoenix] All Ms. Vasquez did was \ push him off the stairs... \ in self defense!

[Edgeworth] What's that now!?

[Phoenix] It's simple!

[Phoenix] Mr. Hammer was intending \ to kill Ms. Vasquez!

[Edgeworth] Wha-!?

[Edgeworth] WHAT!?

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] Jack Hammer drugged \ Mr. Powers with sleeping \ pills!

[Phoenix] Jack Hammer snuck into the \ dressing room and stole \ the Steel Samurai costume!

[Phoenix] Jack Hammer wore the costume \ to fool the security lady \ into thinking he was Powers!

[Phoenix] Then Jack Hammer made \ his way to the trailer!

[Phoenix] And for what purpose, you ask?

[Phoenix] To kill Dee Vasquez, who had \ so cruelly taken advantage \ of him all those years!

[] ...

[Phoenix] So, you did do it, didn't you?

[Vasquez] ... Yes.

[Vasquez] I am guilty.

[Vasquez] It was me...

[] ...

[] "Someone call an ambulance!"

[Edgeworth] In the waiting lobby, \ Your Honor. As calm and \ collected as ever...

[Judge] I see...

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor?

[Judge] It appears you have brought \ about yet another miracle.

[Phoenix] I... thank you, Your Honor.

[Edgeworth] I think not, Your Honor.

[Edgeworth] Will Powers was innocent.

[Edgeworth] That he should be found \ so is only natural... \ not a miracle.

[Judge] ...

[Judge] Yes. \ Yes, you're right.

[Will] Yes... but... it's sad.

[Will] I know now that Mr. Hammer \ stole my costume.

[Will] It's bad enough that he \ wanted to kill Ms. Vasquez...

[Will] But to think that he \ tried to frame me for the \ murder!

[Will] It makes me sad...

[Will] Because I was the \ Steel Samurai?

[Phoenix] Mr. Hammer was a big star, \ once.

[Phoenix] But he was reduced to acting \ in a kids' show... and as \ the villaim, to boot!

[Phoenix] The kids love the Steel \ Samurai.

[Phoenix] And so, he hated you.

[Will] I... I think I understand.

[Will] H-he could have just told me.

[Maya] Meet "again"...?

[Edgeworth] Thanks to you, I am saddled \ with unnecessary... feelings.

[Phoenix] Unnecessary feelings?

[Phoenix] They went back to making \ kids' shows again.

[Maya] Nick!

[Phoenix] (I'll admit, I was kind \ of surprised...)

[Maya] You have to buy trading \ cards too, okay!

[Maya] We have to trade with \ Cody and that assistant!

[Phoenix] Fine, fine. \ I'll do it.

[Maya] Isn't it great that WP \ gets to play the lead again?

[Phoenix] Waterfalls...? \ Dare I ask why?

[Maya] Duh, Nick! \ Isn't it obvious?

[Maya] I need a waterfall to \ stand under! Preferably \ a freezing one!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Oh... Is that part of your \ spirit medium training?

[Maya] Of course! Except, I've \ been slacking off lately...

[Maya] I need to brave the elements \ and be forged anew under the \ rushing spring waters!

[Phoenix] Umm... Okay...

[Phoenix] I don't know about any falls \ per se, but Gourd Lake is \ pretty close...

[Maya] Oh. Darn.

[Phoenix] Sorry, but them's the breaks. \ Couldn't you just take a \ cold shower or something?

[Maya] ...

[Maya] Good idea!

[Phoenix] (So much for the rushing \ spring waters...)

[TV] Next in the news...

[TV] A large, unidentified animal \ was sighted at Gourd Lake!

[TV] The town is buzzing with \ excitement!

[TV] Locals are calling it "Gourdy" \ in a tip of the hat to Nessie, \ the Loch Ness monster.

[TV] Though its namesake, Nessie, \ proved to be a hoax...

[TV] locals are confident their \ Gourdy is the real deal.

[TV] ...

[Phoenix] *yawn* \ Bor-ing.

[Phoenix] Can't they show real \ news for a change?

[Maya] Nick?

[Phoenix] ?

[Maya] The water pressure's kind of \ low in that shower.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] You want more pressure, huh?

[Phoenix] Why don't you go down to the \ fire department and have them \ spray you with the hose?

[Maya] ...

[Maya] Good idea, Nick!

[Phoenix] (Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid \ in detecting sarcasm...)

[TV] We interrupt this program \ to bring you a special news \ bulletin!

[TV] Strange occurrences continue \ at Gourd Lake... But this \ time, it's murder!

[Phoenix] (Gourd Lake again?)

[TV] The body of a man was found in \ the lake early this morning.

[TV] A suspect was apprehended. \ Sources inside the police \ department revealed...

[TV] that the suspect's name \ is Miles Edgeworth, age 24.

[TV] Edgeworth was an up-and-coming \ prosecution attorney, known \ for his skill and connections.

[TV] He was guaranteed a long and \ rewarding career... has he \ thrown it all away?

[Phoenix] (...?)

[Phoenix] (E-Edgeworth!?)

[Phoenix] What's going on!?

[Phoenix] Edgeworth would never \ do something like--

[Maya] Nick?

[Phoenix] Yipes! M-Maya!

[Maya] The fireman yelled at me \ when I called him.

[Phoenix] We've got bigger things to \ worry about than that!

[Phoenix] They arrested Edgeworth!

[Maya] What? You mean, the \ prosecutor?

[Phoenix] Yeah, he's a suspect... \ in a murder!

[Maya] Whaaaaat!?

[Maya] When? Where? Whom? \ Why? How?

[Phoenix] I-I don't know!

[Maya] Wh-what do you mean \ by that?

[Edgeworth] Me? Trust a wet-behind-the- \ ears lawyer with only three \ trials under his belt? Never!

[Maya] Wh-what!?

[Edgeworth] My case is near hopeless, \ Wright.

[Edgeworth] Every defense attorney I've \ talked to has turned me down.

[Phoenix] What?

[Edgeworth] Simply put, they were \ afraid they'd lose.

[Edgeworth] It occurred to me that it \ might be my fault that they \ lack confidence.

[Edgeworth] After all, I did get every \ single one of their clients \ declared "guilty."

[Gumshoe] There's enough of us here! \ Anyone found anything?

[Police] S-sorry, sir... \ Nothing.

[Gumshoe] Idiot! \ The trial's tomorrow!

[Gumshoe] We need clues, on \ the double!

[Police] B-but, sir...

[Police] There weren't any clues... \ that's why we arrested \ that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth!

[Police] It's clear, sir. \ He's the one who--

[Gumshoe] Shaddup!

[Gumshoe] Just you try saying that \ again!

[Gumshoe] I'll... er... I'll make \ you sorry if you do!

[Gumshoe] I mean... just, get \ outta my face, pal!

[Police] Y-yes, sir!

[Maya] Detective Gumshoe's \ kinda scary today!

[Gumshoe] Recruits... peh!

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] Aah!

[Maya] Eek!

[Gumshoe] Hey, you're that \ Harry guy! Harry Butz!

[Phoenix] Wright! Phoenix Wright! \ (Will he ever learn my name!?)

[Gumshoe] And just what are you doing \ here, pal? Investigating!?

[Phoenix] Huh? Um, well, yes. \ I suppose.

[Gumshoe] Well, I'm here to help! \ Ask me anything you want!

[Gumshoe] Bring it!

[Maya] He seems different than usual. \ I wonder what's up?

[Maya] Umm...

[Maya] Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually \ asked us to defend him yet...

[Gumshoe] Huh!?

[Gumshoe] Oh? Y-you don't say...

[] ...

***Examine sign*****************************

[Phoenix] The sign says "Gourd Lake \ Nature Park."

[Phoenix] This place is full of families \ picnicking on the weekend.

[Maya] But... no waterfall.

[Phoenix] Not many picnickers come here \ for spiritual training, Maya.

********************************************

***Examine trees****************************

[Phoenix] I feel winter's chill from the \ bare leaf trees today...

[Phoenix] *sigh* \ What is it about winter that \ turns people into poets?

[Maya] I don't know, but my toes \ are starting to feel numb.

[Phoenix] (Yes... my poetry has that \ effect on some people.)

********************************************

***Present Attorney's Badge*****************

[Gumshoe] That badge!

[Gumshoe] You're showing that to \ the wrong guy, pal!

[Gumshoe] You gotta show that to \ someone who needs it!

********************************************

***Talk about "What happened"***************

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe?

[Phoenix] Do you know what \ happened here?

[Gumshoe] Huh? You don't know, pal?

[Phoenix] No...

[Gumshoe] Wow, okay, Mr. head-in-the- \ fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.

[Phoenix] Head-in-the... huh?

[Gumshoe] Never mind, I'll tell you.

[Gumshoe] It happened last night, about \ 15 minutes after midnight.

[Gumshoe] There was a boat out \ on Gourd Lake.

[Gumshoe] In that boat were two men.

[Gumshoe] One of those men shot \ the other with a pistol.

[Maya] And... the shooter was \ Mr. Edgeworth?

[Gumshoe] A cop who arrived on the \ scene arrested him.

[Maya] How did he get there \ so fast?

[Gumshoe] Well...

[Gumshoe] There was a witness.

[Gumshoe] When the report came in, \ we raced to the lake.

[Phoenix] A witness?

********************************************

***Talk about "Edgeworth"*******************

[Maya] You don't think Mr. Edgeworth \ is a... murderer!?

[Gumshoe] Absolutely not! \ It's impossible!

[Gumshoe] I don't care if there's \ a witness either! I don't \ believe a lick of it!

[Maya] R-right! Who cares what \ the witness says!

[Phoenix] (I care!)

[Maya] ...

[Maya] You really believe in him, \ don't you, Detective?

[Gumshoe] Course I do!

[Gumshoe] But... the police are pretty \ sure he's the killer.

[Gumshoe] Nobody's even really taking \ this investigation that \ seriously.

[Maya] Oh no!

[Gumshoe] After all the help Mr. \ Edgeworth has been to us...

[Gumshoe] Hard to imaging that no one's \ standing up to take his side.

[Maya] Well, at least you are, \ Detective. At least you are.

********************************************

***Talk about "Defense request"*************

***Before talking to Edgeworth**************

[] * -Maya \ * Do you know who will be Mr. \ * Edgeworth's defense attorney \ * in tomorrow's trial?

[] * -Gumshoe \ * He hasn't got one yet.

[] * -Maya \ * What?

[] * -Maya \ * The trial IS tomorrow, \ * isn't it?

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Well, I don't know the \ * whole story...

[] * -Gumshoe \ * But apparently no one he's \ * been talking to will take \ * his case.

[] * -Maya \ * W-why not?

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Mr. Edgeworth won't tell me!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * When you guys showed up, \ * I figured he'd asked you \ * to defend him.

[] * -Phoenix \ * U-unfortunately not...

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Well, pal, then you got \ * a job to do! Help out \ * Mr. Edgeworth!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Prove that badge you wear \ * isn't just some fancy piece \ * of metal!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Prove it to me, pal! \ * Show me you're an attorney!

********************************************

***After talking to Edgeworth***************

[] * -Maya \ * I-is it true?

[] * -Maya \ * No one will take \ * Mr. Edgeworth's case?

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Yeah...

[] * -Gumshoe \ * He's a bit of a celebrity.

[] * -Gumshoe \ * If you defended him, and \ * lost, your reputation'd \ * be sure to suffer.

[] * -Gumshoe \ * What's more...

[] * -Gumshoe \ * The case against him is... \ * well, it's pretty solid.

[] * -Phoenix \ * (I suppose it would be if \ * they have a witness.)

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Hey! Pal!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Don't tell me you're going \ * to turn your back on him too!?

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Remember the Steel Samurai!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Mr. Edgeworth helped you get \ * your client declared innocent!

[] * -Phoenix \ * I... I know.

[] * -Phoenix \ * I went to Edgeworth. I tried.

[] * -Phoenix \ * He really doesn't want \ * us to represent him.

[] * -Phoenix \ * Especially not us, he said.

[] * -Gumshoe \ * What!?

[] * -Gumshoe \ * W-well, that doesn't make \ * any sense, pal!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * You should have heard him \ * talking about you after the \ * Steel Samurai case!

[] * -Gumshoe \ * He kept saying "Wright, \ * Wright, Wright" over and over.

[] * -Maya \ * ...

[] * -Maya \ * Nick?

[] * -Maya \ * I'm not sure that's \ * a good sign.

[] * -Phoenix \ * Neither am I...

[] * -Gumshoe \ * Why wouldn't he want \ * your help?

[] * -Gumshoe \ * I don't get it.

********************************************

********************************************

***Talk about "The witness"*****************

[Phoenix] Who was this witness?

[Gumshoe] Er, sorry, pal. \ That's confidential.

[Gumshoe] Anyway, the witness \ saw everything, apparently.

[Gumshoe] I'm sure they'll turn \ up at the trial tomorrow.

[Phoenix] Was there only that \ one witness?

[Gumshoe] Yep. It was pretty cold \ out on the lake last night.

[Gumshoe] And, it was Christmas Eve \ after all.

[Gumshoe] Still, we're being thorough.

[Gumshoe] You never know when you're \ going to turn up another \ witness.

[Gumshoe] That's why we're here \ today, checking things out.

[Gumshoe] So far, we're coming up \ empty...

[Maya] Oh! It's Christmas today! \ I'd forgotten.

[Maya] What are you getting \ me for Christmas, Nick?

[Phoenix] Talk to Santa.

********************************************

[] AFTER TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING

[Police] Detective Gumshoe, sir!

[Gumshoe] What? \ Find something!?

[Police] Um, no, sir. Not yet.

[Police] But there was a call from the \ precinct. They want to hold \ an investigation briefing...

[Gumshoe] A briefing?

[Gumshoe] Right! \ I'm off!

[Gumshoe] Oh...

[Gumshoe] Sorry, pal. \ I guess you heard. I gotta go.

[Gumshoe] Any last things you want \ to ask me about before \ I head back?

***The autopsy report***********************

[Maya] Well, yes. \ Do you have any information \ on the victim...?

[Gumshoe] Sorry...

[Gumshoe] They haven't worked up \ the autopsy report yet.

[Gumshoe] I'm still waiting for \ it myself.

[Gumshoe] Actually...

[Gumshoe] Say, if you get the time, \ drop by the precinct!

[Gumshoe] We can talk more there, pal!

[] CONTINUE

[Phoenix] You're not coming \ back, Detective?

[Gumshoe] Erm... \ Probably not, pal.

[Phoenix] So, what should we do if \ we have something to talk \ to you about...?

[Gumshoe] Ah, right.

[Gumshoe] Here, I'll show you how \ to get to the precinct. Come \ down and see me anytime.

[] Detective Gumshoe gave you \ directions to the police \ station.

[Phoenix] Oh, hey! \ Detective Gumshoe!

[Gumshoe] W-what!?

[Phoenix] Um, we'd like to take \ a look around in the park.

[Phoenix] Can we walk around?

[Gumshoe] Yeah! No problem, pal. \ You got my permission.

[Maya] You know, Nick.

[Maya] I think there's something to \ be said for talking to people \ when they're busy.

[Phoenix] Yeah. They don't have time to \ think about not giving you \ information...

[Maya] Right! \ Now, let's get investigating!

[] MOVE TO: Criminal Affairs Dept.

[Maya] Looks like Detective Gumshoe \ isn't here.

[Chief] Something wrong, miss?

[Chief] Hmm? Turning yourself in?

[Chief] Okay, what did you do? \ Shoplifting? Larceny? \ Public indecency...?

[Maya] N-no! None of those things!

[Maya] We're looking for DetectiveG \ Gumshoe... is he around?

[Chief] Gumshoe?

[Chief] Oh yeah. \ He's in a meeting right now.

[Chief] I don't think he'll be out \ any time soon.

[Maya] Okay, we'll come back.

[Chief] You do that.

[Chief] Oh, and go straight home \ and stay out of trouble.

[Chief] No more shoplifting, \ you got that?

[Maya] ...

[Maya] Do I look like a criminal \ or something?

***Examine desks****************************

[Phoenix] These are the detectives' \ desks.

[Phoenix] There are computers and files \ on each one. Funny, they're a \ lot tidier than I'd expect.

[Phoenix] I guess the detectives don't \ spend a lot of time at their \ desks.

********************************************

***Examine chief****************************

[Phoenix] This must be the chief \ of the detectives here.

[Phoenix] He's glued to his computer \ screen.

[Chief] Wha...!? \ "Gourd Lake...!"

[Chief] "Gourdy sighted"!!! \ I don't believe it!

[Phoenix] (Shouldn't you be reading \ something more important...?)

********************************************

***Examine detective************************

[Phoenix] That must be one of the \ detectives.

[Phoenix] He's mumbling something \ to himself.

[Police] "...your mama could see \ you know she'd be cryin'...?

[Police] "...a break and spit it \ out, you lowlife scumbag..."

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] He must be doing image \ training for interrogations.

********************************************

***Examine poster***************************

[Phoenix] A poster of a female \ police officer...

[Phoenix] Wait, no. That's the latest \ "Babes in Uniform" calendar. \ My bad.

********************************************

***Examine Blue Badger**********************

[Phoenix] Hey, is that the police \ department's mascot...?

[Chief] That's the "Blue Badger"!

[Chief] It was my idea! I made it! \ It's my mascot!

[Phoenix] I... see. How nice.

[Chief] I'll get him assigned mascot \ of the Criminal Affairs Dept. \ if it's the last thing I do!

[Phoenix] Um, good luck!

[] December 25 \ Gourd Lake \ Public Beach

[Maya] Wowsers! \ This is "Gourd Lake"?

[Phoenix] Yup.

[Phoenix] I'm not sure it warrants \ a "wowsers," though.

[Maya] Hmm. Probably not.

[Maya] But hey, look at \ that snack stand!

[Phoenix] "Samurai Dogs"...?

[Maya] I wanna Samurai Dog! \ Please!

[Maya] I bet they're great!

[Phoenix] With a name like Samurai Dog, \ how could they not be?

[Maya] They're a little behind \ the times, though.

[Maya] The kids are all into \ "The Pink Princess" now.

[Maya] I mean, like, y'know!?

[Phoenix] (Nope.)

[] ...

***Examine lake*****************************

[Maya] Wow. \ Gourd Lake is really big.

[Phoenix] Yeah.

[Maya] Say, Nick. \ Why is it called "Gourd Lake"?

[Phoenix] Oh.

[Phoenix] Well, a long time ago, they \ used to grow gourds here.

[Maya] Whoa! No way!

[Maya] I was sure it was because \ the lake looked like a gourd \ when viewed from above!

[Maya] You know, like an hourglass \ shape?

[Phoenix] Well, it is shaped like a \ gourd, actually. But that's \ just a coincidence.

[Maya] Oh. \ Okay.

********************************************

***Examine trashcan*************************

[Phoenix] The trashcan is empty.

[Phoenix] At least the place \ is well maintained.

********************************************

***Examine benches**************************

[Phoenix] A lineup of plastic benches.

[Phoenix] I guess the idea is you \ buy a dog and eat it here.

[Phoenix] I doubt anyone would sit here \ and eat on a day like this.

[Phoenix] Except maybe Maya... if \ she had a Samurai Dog.

********************************************

***Examine hot dog stand********************

[Phoenix] A hotdog stand. \ It's closed...

[Phoenix] The Christmas fringe looks \ a little half-baked.

[Phoenix] The banner reads \ "Samurai Dogs"...

[Phoenix] Somebody needs to redecorate.

********************************************

***Examine signpost*************************

[Phoenix] Huh... I almost didn't see \ that signpost.

[Phoenix] "Left - Boat Docks" \ "Right - Exit"

********************************************

***Examine popper (on bench)****************

[Maya] Huh. Someone left one of those \ poppers here. You know, you \ pull the string...

[Phoenix] ...and it goes "pop." Yeah, \ I know the ones. You see them \ a lot around New Year's.

[Maya] Hey, Nick! It might \ be a clue!

[Maya] Let's take it.

[Phoenix] C'mon, admit it. You just \ want to pop it, right?

[Maya] Was it that obvious?

[Phoenix] (A popper... hmm.)

***Take it**********************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * I suppose it couldn't hurt.

[] * -Phoenix \ * Huh? Where'd it go?

[] * -Maya \ * I already put it in my pocket.

[] * Popper put in pocket.

********************************************

***Leave it*********************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * Nah, let's leave it.

[] MOVE TO: Gourd Lake Entrance \ Gourd Lake Public Beach \ Boat Rental Shop

[] ...

[] December 25 \ Boat Rental Shop

[Maya] Nick... what is this place?

[Phoenix] A boat rental shop. \ Closed for Christmas \ it seems.

[Phoenix] I guess a murder taking place \ on one of the boats won't be \ good for business, either.

[Maya] Boats... \ I've never ridden on a boat.

[Phoenix] Really? Well, how about we \ go out on one when the trial \ is finished?

[Maya] Hey, good idea! \ You bet!

[] ...

***Examine forest***************************

[Phoenix] There's more forest \ off that way.

[Phoenix] I doubt I'd find any \ helpful clues in there.

********************************************

***Examine boat rental shop*****************

[Phoenix] A small boat rental shop.

[Phoenix] Doesn't look like anyone \ is around.

[Phoenix] They're probably closed \ because it's Christmas.

********************************************

***Examine boats****************************

[Phoenix] There are some boats floating \ at the dock.

[Phoenix] Was one of these boats used \ in the murder, I wonder?

[Maya] Nick?

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Maya] Hey, hey, Nick!

[Maya] If they were camping here \ last night, they might know \ something about the murder!

[Phoenix] (That's true...)

[Phoenix] Good call, Maya. Let's go \ talk to them.

***Examine SUV******************************

[Phoenix] This SUV has seen better days.

[Phoenix] It's dented all over.

[Phoenix] I can't believe anyone would \ drive their car down here.

********************************************

***Examine sign*****************************

[Phoenix] The sign says "No Camping."

[Phoenix] Funny place to pick to \ pitch your tent.

[Maya] Wait, what if the \ sign said "No Setting \ Tents on Fire"?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] I don't think they have \ signs like that.

[Maya] Oh...

********************************************

***Examine firepit**************************

[Maya] Hey, Nick!

[Phoenix] What, don't tell me \ you're hungry again?

[Maya] No, no.

[Maya] I was just wondering, why \ are camping pots and pans \ made of aluminum.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] They didn't talk about that \ in any of the law books.

[Maya] So, there's no law saying they \ have to be made out of \ aluminum, then!

[Phoenix] (I'm not having this \ conversation...)

********************************************

***Examine blanket**************************

[Phoenix] There's food and some \ magazines on the sheet.

[Phoenix] It takes a pretty tough \ skin to camp in this cold.

[] * -Maya \ * *cough*

[] * -Maya \ * "Hi, I'm Nick!"

[Lotta] Huh? Device?

[Maya] It started moving all by \ itself when I fired my \ party popper...

[Lotta] Oh that? That triggers the \ shutter whenever it detects \ certain sounds.

[Lotta] A pistol...?

[Phoenix] Right. Now wouldn't a gunshot \ make a similar noise to our \ party popper...?

[Lotta] I guess it would.

[Phoenix] Your camera... didn't get \ a picture of the murder, \ did it?

[Lotta] ...

[Lotta] Hey!

[Gumshoe] Hey!

[Gumshoe] Thanks for coming down, pal!

[Maya] Detective Gumshoe!

[Gumshoe] We just finished the meeting. \ For better or for worse...

[Phoenix] (I get the feeling we're in \ for some bad news...)

[] ...

***Examine detective************************

[Phoenix] That must be one of the \ detectives.

[Phoenix] He's mumbling something \ to himself.

[Police] "All right, hands against the \ wall, all o' you..."

[Police] "Don't even think about \ escaping! I got eyes in \ the back of my head!"

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] He must be doing image \ training for arrests.

********************************************

***Present other****************************

[Gumshoe] Sorry, I'm drawing \ a blank right now.

***Talk about "The victim"******************

[Phoenix] Do you know anything \ about the victim yet?

[Gumshoe] No, no... \ Still can't I.D. him.

[Maya] Has Mr. Edgeworth \ said anything?

[Gumshoe] Not a word.

********************************************

***Talk about "The meeting"*****************

[Phoenix] So, how did the meeting go?

[Gumshoe] I can't tell you, pal! \ You're a lawyer!

[Phoenix] T-true...

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] Y'know...

[Gumshoe] I don't know what \ to believe anymore.

[Gumshoe] Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's \ human like you or me.

[Gumshoe] Still...

[Gumshoe] I get the feeling that if \ he'd done something wrong, \ he wouldn't go hiding it.

[Gumshoe] That's just the kind \ of guy he is.

[Gumshoe] Why can't anyone else \ see that?

[Maya] So, they think that \ Mr. Edgeworth did it...?

[Gumshoe] Well, the trial's starting \ tomorrow, as scheduled.

[Maya] I see...

[Gumshoe] ...

[Phoenix] Umm... hey, in the end you \ did tell us about the meeting!

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] Stand by Mr. Edgeworth!

[Gumshoe] He needs help, and you'r \ the ones to help him!

[Gumshoe] I'm sure he's got some reason \ why he won't talk to us.

[Maya] Thanks, Detective Gumshoe.

********************************************

***Talk about "Trusting Edgeworth"**********

[Maya] Detective Gumshoe...

[Maya] How come you trust \ Mr. Edgeworth so much?

[Gumshoe] Well, I'd think that \ was obvious.

[Gumshoe] We got a strong working \ relationship, us two.

[Gumshoe] We trust each other, \ and that's how it works.

[Maya] A "working relationship"?

[Gumshoe] See, Mr. Edgeworth always \ gets his defendants declared \ "guilty" every time.

[Gumshoe] Yeah, his methods might be \ a little extreme at times.

[Gumshoe] But... there's a reason!

[Gumshoe] He trusts our investigation, \ see? He trusts us to get the \ right man!

[Gumshoe] That's why I work \ extra hard, pal.

[Gumshoe] We've got to earn that \ trust he places in us.

[Maya] I see...

[Gumshoe] Mr. Edgeworth is a man \ you can trust...

[Gumshoe] And you have my \ word on that!

********************************************

***Talk about "The autopsy report"**********

[Phoenix] I was wondering, did you \ ever get that autopsy report?

[Gumshoe] Oh, that? \ Yeah, I made a copy for you.

[Butz] What? Edgey's got a \ proboscis on his knee!?

[Maya] No, no--he's a "prosecuting \ attorney."

[Maya] ...

[Maya] And the police blamed my \ mother, calling her a fraud.

[Maya] You were the one who helped \ her out then, right, \ Mr. Grossberg?

[Grossberg] Er... y-yes. Yes, quite.

[Maya] Thank you!

[Grossberg] N-no... please. \ D-don't mention it.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] (DL-6...)

[Phoenix] (Never thought I'd hear that \ name again...)

[Maya] But wait...

[Maya] What does that case have \ anything to do with Mr. \ Edgeworth?

[Grossberg] It has everything to do \ with Mr. Edgeworth, my dear!

[Grossberg] The victim in the DL-6 Incident \ was none other than his \ father, Gregory Edgeworth!

[Maya] Wh-what!? \ His father!?

[Grossberg] ...

[Grossberg] If you want to know more, \ you should ask him yourself.

[] CONTINUE IF FIRST TIME

[Grossberg] Show him this... \ I'm sure he'll talk to you.

[Maya] Wait...

[Maya] This is a photograph of \ my mother!

[Gumshoe] What's going on here!?

[Maya] Eek!

[Phoenix] W-what's wrong, Detective?

[Gumshoe] This wild lady comes \ in here just a while ago...

[Gumshoe] Says she came "to talk to \ y'all after hearing what \ Mr. Wright had to say"!

[Gumshoe] What's this all about, pal!?

[Phoenix] (Lotta Hart...)

[Gumshoe] Why are you going around \ finding more witnesses!?

[Gumshoe] You want to give Mr. Edgeworth \ the death sentence, pal!?

[Phoenix] N-no, not at all...

[Phoenix] Just... I mean, she did see \ something. There's nothing \ I can do about that.

[Phoenix] I can't go around covering \ up evidence!

[Gumshoe] Er...

[Gumshoe] You trying to say something \ about the way I do my job?

[Phoenix] No sir!

[] ...

***Examine detective************************

[Phoenix] That must be one of the \ detectives.

[Phoenix] He's mumbling something \ to himself.

[Police] "Never talk to people \ in the neighborhood..."

[Police] "Turn all the lights in \ the room off, and close \ the curtains..."

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] He must be doing image \ training for a stake-out.

********************************************

***Present anything*************************

[Gumshoe] Hey, pal, there's only one \ thing I want to see from you!

[Gumshoe] And that's a letter of request \ from Mr. Edgeworth for you to \ be his defense attorney!

********************************************

***Talk about "Lotta's testimony"***********

[Phoenix] So... what did Ms. Hart say?

[Gumshoe] She says she saw Mr. Edgeworth \ fire the pistol.

[Maya] What!?

[Gumshoe] She even had a photograph \ to prove it.

[Phoenix] Right. \ I saw it too...

[Phoenix] But you really can't tell \ from the photo who it is \ shooting.

[Gumshoe] That's why she said she's \ going to enlarge the photo.

[Gumshoe] She said "it'll drop the \ quality a mite, but should \ let us see who's who!"

[Maya] She can do that!?

[Phoenix] (OKay, so there's going to be \ an enlarged photograph that \ shows Edgeworth in the act.)

[Phoenix] (Great. Just great.)

[Gumshoe] In any case, she's going to be \ the one testifying tomorrow.

[Maya] Huh?

[Maya] What happened to the other \ witness?

[Gumshoe] Well...

[Gumshoe] Apparently, there was a \ cancellation.

[Phoenix] (A "cancellation"...!?)

********************************************

***Talk about "Tomorrow's trial"************

[Gumshoe] I'm afraid tomorrow is going \ to be life or death for poor \ Mr. Edgeworth.

[Gumshoe] We got a witness who says \ she saw the very moment of \ the murder.

[Gumshoe] And we got a photo taken \ when the shot rang out.

[Phoenix] (I'd say that sounds like a \ pretty unwinnable case...)

[Phoenix] (But wait... \ What did Mia used to say?)

[Phoenix] (If he's innocent, there's \ got to be something I've \ overlooked...)

********************************************

***Talk about "Edgeworth"*******************

[Gumshoe] It sounds like Mr. Edgeworth \ is going to ask the state to \ assign a public defender.

[Gumshoe] I was just asked to file \ the paperwork.

[Gumshoe] But you still got time, pal!

[Gumshoe] Go talk to him again, \ for me, please!

[Gumshoe] You have to convince him!

[Gumshoe] You have to make him let \ you defend him! Please!

[Gumshoe] I know you're the only one \ who can do it, pal.

[Gumshoe] You're the only one who \ can save Mr. Edgeworth!

[Edgeworth] What's this?

[Edgeworth] I was hoping you'd gotten \ my message the first time.

[Phoenix] Edgeworth, what about \ your defense?

[Edgeworth] ...!

[Edgeworth] It's no concern of yours.

[Phoenix] (Guess he hasn't found \ anyone yet.)

[] ...

***Talk about "What happened"***************

[Phoenix] Can I ask you about \ the murder?

[Edgeworth] Wright.

[Edgeworth] I'll ask you again, \ just leave me alone.

[Phoenix] ...

[Edgeworth] Please try to understand.

[Edgeworth] I'm not doing this to prove \ I'm tough, or because I look \ down on you.

[Edgeworth] I just don't want you \ anywhere near this case. \ Understand?

********************************************

***Talk about "Gourd Lake"******************

[Phoenix] Why did you go to \ Gourd Lake?

[Edgeworth] I have no intention \ of telling you.

[Phoenix] Nor, apparently, would \ you tell Detective Gumshoe.

[Edgeworth] !

[Maya] Detective Gumshoe was \ really worried about you!

[Edgeworth] Who would have thought \ there'd be a photo...?

[Phoenix] Edgeworth... \ Did you shoot him?

[Edgeworth] What do you think, Wright?

[Phoenix] I don't think you're the \ kind to point a gun at \ anyone, no.

[Maya] So you didn't shoot him?

[Edgeworth] No, I didn't. \ It wasn't me.

********************************************

***Present other****************************

[Edgeworth] What's that?

[Edgeworth] I'm not in the mood \ for idle banter, Wright.

***Present Misty Fey's Photo****************

[Edgeworth] ...!

[Edgeworth] ...

[Phoenix] Edgeworth?

[Edgeworth] It's only been a matter of \ hours since you last visited.

[Edgeworth] Yet you've made incredible \ progress in your \ investigation.

[Edgeworth] I'll admit it, I'm impressed, \ Wright.

[Edgeworth] You were always single- \ minded in your work, though.

[Edgeworth] Once you start on something, \ you always see it through, \ don't you?

[Phoenix] About the "DL-6 Incident"...

[Edgeworth] Right... DL-6.

[Edgeworth] I didn't want you to \ find out about it.

[Edgeworth] That is why I refused your \ offer to defend me.

[Edgeworth] I'm sorry if it sounded \ like I thought you weren't \ up to the job.

[Edgeworth] I just wanted to keep \ you away from DL-6.

[Phoenix] So... do you still think \ it would have been better \ for me to stay away?

[Edgeworth] I don't know.

[Edgeworth] But...

[Edgeworth] I see no point in hiding \ anything from you now.

[Edgeworth] Very well.

[Edgeworth] Ask whatever you like, and \ I will answer to the best \ of my abilities.

********************************************

***Talk about "The DL6 Incident"***********

[Edgeworth] The "DL-6 Incident"... \ was when my father died.

[Edgeworth] Right before my eyes...

[Edgeworth] He was shot and killed, \ and I saw it all.

[Maya] ...!

[Edgeworth] My memories from that \ time are... foggy.

[Edgeworth] I suppose it's a self-defense \ mechanism.

[Edgeworth] In any case, a suspect \ was arrested... a man.

[Edgeworth] It's pretty clear he was the \ only one who could have killed \ my father.

[Edgeworth] The spirit medium they used to \ talk to my late father said \ the same thing.

[Edgeworth] It was an attorney by the name \ of Robert Hammond that cleared \ the suspect's name.

[Phoenix] And Hammond... is the victim \ in the Gourd Lake murder?

[Edgeworth] Correct.

[Maya] Umm...

[Maya] That spirit medium... \ that was my mom.

[Edgeworth] What? You mean you're...?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] It's strange.

[Edgeworth] I thought that terrible \ incident was about to end, \ and now... this.

[Phoenix] "About to end"?

[Edgeworth] The DL-6 Incident happened \ 15 years ago.

[Edgeworth] 15 years ago... \ on December 28.

[Maya] December 28?

[Edgeworth] The statute of limitations \ on the case runs out in \ three days.

[Phoenix] What!?

[Maya] Um, Nick? \ What does that mean?

[Phoenix] When a case's statute of \ limitations runs out, legally, \ the case never happened.

[Edgeworth] Three days from now, DL-6 \ will be closed... forever.

********************************************

***Talk about "The suspect"*****************

[Maya] What happened to the suspect? \ The one who got off innocent?

[Edgeworth] I don't know...

[Edgeworth] He disappeared from public \ view. Nobody knows where to.

[Edgeworth] If he's still alive, he'd \ be about 50 years old now.

[Phoenix] (I guess I can understand \ why he'd go into hiding...)

[Phoenix] (It'd be hard to live a normal \ life after being a murder \ suspect in such a big case.)

********************************************

***Talk about "Your father"*****************

[Maya] Umm... so, was your \ father a lawyer?

[Edgeworth] He was...

[Edgeworth] Gregory Edgeworth. \ He was quite famous at \ the time, apparently.

[Maya] So, you were sort of trying \ to follow in his footsteps.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] I'd rather not talk about it.

********************************************

[] AFTER TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING IMPORTANT

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Wright.

[Phoenix] ?

[Edgeworth] It pains me to ask you \ this now...

[Maya] I know! You want us \ to defend you!

[Edgeworth] Yes... Will you?

***Of course we will***********************

[Phoenix] Ah, who could have \ guessed this day \ would come?

[Edgeworth] Not me.

[Phoenix] I was kidding!

[Phoenix] Just a little joke!

[Edgeworth] There was nothing little...

[Maya] ...or joke-like about it!

[Phoenix] (I thought it was funny...)

[Maya] Nick! \ Do it over!

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] How could I refuse you, \ Edgeworth?

[Edgeworth] Thank you, Wright.

[Phoenix] This is my chance to \ finally pay you back.

[Maya] Pay him back...?

[Edgeworth] Pay me back?

[Edgeworth] For what? \ I don't remember ever doing \ anything for you.

[Phoenix] Never mind... I guess you \ don't really need to know.

[Edgeworth] Huh...

[Edgeworth] My letter of request. \ Please give it to \ Detective Gumshoe.

[] Edgeworth's Request put \ in pocket.

[Phoenix] Well, I guess we should...

[Phoenix] ...?

[Phoenix] W-what's that!?

[Maya] E-earthquake! \ Nick!

[Maya] It's a big one!

[Maya] Whaaaaa!

[Maya] I-it's calming down...

[Maya] ...

[Maya] Whew... that was scary!

[Phoenix] ...?

[Phoenix] Huh? Where's Edgeworth?

[Maya] ...

[Maya] There.

[Maya] He's on the floor in \ a ball, shivering.

[Maya] I guess he doesn't do \ so well with earthquakes.

[Phoenix] (I've heard of running, but \ curling up in a ball?)

[Maya] Well, I guess we're done.

[Maya] Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem \ like he's going to stand up \ any time soon.

[Maya] Let's go, Nick.

[Phoenix] Uh... right.

[Phoenix] We have to give Edgeworth's \ letter of request to Detective \ Gumshoe.

[] MOVE TO: Criminal Affairs Dept.

[] ...

***Present Edgeworth's Request**************

[Phoenix] Look what I got.

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] Hey, you did it, pal!

[Gumshoe] Glad I waited till the last \ minute to file those papers!

[Gumshoe] I'll rip 'em up and start \ new ones for you!

[Phoenix] Thanks, Detective.

[Phoenix] Well, see you in court \ tomorrow, then.

[Gumshoe] Good luck, pal.

[Gumshoe] Hey!

[Gumshoe] You guys feel that earthquake \ a little while back?

[Gumshoe] I was worried!

[Maya] Worried?

[Maya] We're fine! I've lived out \ here my whole life. I'm pretty \ used to them by now.

[Gumshoe] Oh, I wasn't worried about \ you two.

[Gumshoe] I was worried about \ Mr. Edgeworth!

[Phoenix] (Oh, right...)

[Phoenix] He did seem to over-react \ a little, now that you \ mention it.

[Gumshoe] Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. \ It was a pretty big quake.

[Gumshoe] I'm going to go check on him.

[Gumshoe] You two go eat and get your \ rest for tomorrow's trial.

[Gumshoe] Later!

[Maya] ...

[Maya] I wonder what it is with \ Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes?

[Phoenix] I wonder...

[Phoenix] He was never that scared \ of them when he was in \ school.

[Phoenix] (Then again, I was only in \ the same class as him for \ 4th grade.)

[Phoenix] (He transferred to another \ school after that.)

[Phoenix] (I wonder what happened \ to Edgeworth...)

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green December 26, 9:44 AM \ District Court \ Defendant Lobby No. 2

[Phoenix] Karma...?

[Edgeworth] That's right, Manfred von \ Karma. He's the best \ prosecutor there is.

[Edgeworth] He hasn't lost a case \ in his 40-year career.

[Edgeworth] He is a god of prosecution, \ Wright! A god!

[Maya] Not a single case?

[Edgeworth] He'll do anything to get \ a guilty verdict, anything.

[Phoenix] Hmm. Sounds like someone \ else I know, Edgeworth.

[Edgeworth] Hmph.

[Edgeworth] You don't understand.

[Edgeworth] I mean he'll really do \ anything. Manfred von Karma \ is a man to be feared.

[Phoenix] (That's quite a claim coming \ from someone who forges \ evidence...)

[Edgeworth] He taught me what it really \ means to "prosecute."

[Phoenix] Wh-what!?

[Edgeworth] Just picture a prosecutor \ as vicious as me... multiplied \ by a factor of ten.

[Maya] Ugh...

[Maya] So... so was he your teacher, \ then, Mr. Edgeworth?

[Edgeworth] Something like that...

[Maya] And now he's trying to \ get you found guilty!? \ What a creep!

[Maya] Oh, wait...

[Maya] Maybe he's planning on losing \ on purpose to help you out!

[Edgeworth] Not a chance...

[Edgeworth] He hasn't lost once in \ 40 years. 40 years!

[Edgeworth] He's as ruthless as me, \ times twenty!

[Maya] That's pretty ruthless...

[Edgeworth] Like I said. He's a god \ among prosecutors.

[Phoenix] (I guess that's something \ like Mia was to me.)

[Phoenix] (Speaking of Mia...)

[Phoenix] Um, Maya?

[Maya] Uh huh?

[Phoenix] We could really be using Mia's \ help right now... don't \ you think?

[Maya] Oh...

[Phoenix] ?

[Maya] I can't.

[Maya] Sorry. I tried, I really \ tried, but I couldn't reach.

[Phoenix] You couldn't "reach"?

[Maya] I think it's because I \ haven't been training.

[Maya] My powers are weak again...

[Phoenix] Oh man, what bad timing!

[Maya] I'm really sorry.

[Maya] I'll try my best!

[Phoenix] I hope so!

[Edgeworth] What are you whispering about?

[Phoenix] O-oh, it's nothing.

[Phoenix] Well, it's time. \ Let's head in...

[] ...

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green December 26, 10:00 AM \ District Court \ Courtroom No. 3

[] Court is now in session for \ the trial of Mr. Miles \ Edgeworth.

[Phoenix] The defense is ready, \ Your Honor.

[Karma] ...

[Judge] Erm, Mr. von Karma? \ Is the prosecution ready?

[Karma] ...

[Karma] Fool...

[Karma] You seriously think that \ I would stand here were \ I not completely prepared?

[Judge] R-right, \ my apologies!

[Phoenix] (He's even got the Judge \ scared!)

[Judge] Very well, your opening \ statement, please.

[Karma] ...

[Karma] Decisive evidence...

[Karma] A decisive witness...

[Karma] What else could possibly \ be required?

[Judge] Ah... er, nothing of course. \ That should be fine.

[Judge] The prosecution may call \ its first witness.

[Maya] What's with this guy? Is he \ royalty or something?

[Phoenix] How am I supposed to fight \ against this!?

[Karma] I call the detective in charge \ of this case, Detective Dick \ Gumshoe.

[Phoenix] (Okay, Gumshoe's first... \ Let's see how this goes.)

[] ...

[Karma] Describe the incident. Now!

[Gumshoe] Y-yessir!

[Phoenix] (Detective Gumshoe looks \ nervous...)

[Gumshoe] Er, please take a look \ at the map.

[Gumshoe] The murder happened late \ Christmas Eve, around \ midnight.

[Gumshoe] There was one boat in the \ very middle of the lake.

[Gumshoe] There were two men \ on the boat.

[Gumshoe] Now, there happened to \ be a woman camping here \ on the edge of the lake.

[Gumshoe] At 12:10 AM, she heard two \ pistol shots.

[Gumshoe] Then the boat started to move.

[Gumshoe] It went towards the boat \ rental shop.

[Karma] Hmm.

[] Overhead Map added to \ the Court Record.

[Karma] Testify to the court \ about your arrest. Now!

[Judge] W-w-wait! \ Mr. von Karma...

[Karma] Yes?

[Judge] Actually, I'm the one \ that's supposed to be \ handling these proceedings...

[Karma] Wrong. There is only one \ thing you need to do here.

[Karma] You will slam down your \ gavel and say the word \ "guilty." That is your role!

[Judge] Y-yes, of course. \ You're quite right.

[Phoenix] (No he's not!!!)

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- The Arrest of Edgeworth --

[Gumshoe] (1) \ A man called into the station \ around 30 minutes after \ midnight.

[Gumshoe] (2) \ We headed to the scene of \ the crime as fast as we could.

[Gumshoe] (3) \ That's where we found \ Mr. Edgeworth.

[Gumshoe] (4) \ Now, I didn't suspect \ him of anything at all.

[Gumshoe] (5) \ But... the next morning, \ a body was found in the lake.

[Gumshoe] (6) \ So we had to arrest \ Mr. Edgeworth.

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm... I see. \ Very well...

[Karma] Begin your cross-examination, \ attorney. Now!

[Judge] ...

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- The Arrest of Edgeworth --

[Gumshoe] (1) \ A man called into the station \ around 30 minutes after \ midnight.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] You received a call from \ a "man"?

[Gumshoe] Er... yup.

[Phoenix] But you said there was \ a woman camping there?

[Phoenix] She was the one who \ heard the two gunshots, right?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] That woman and the "man" who \ called in the report are two \ different people, obviously!

[Phoenix] Different people?

[Karma] There were two witnesses!

[Phoenix] (Urk!)

[Karma] Their testimonies were \ quite similar however.

[Karma] Today I've summoned the \ woman who was camping.

[Phoenix] (The woman who was camping... \ Lotta Hart.)

[Karma] What happened next, Detective?

[Gumshoe] (2) \ We headed to the scene of \ the crime as fast as we could.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] How long was it between \ receiving the report and your \ arrival at te lake?

[Gumshoe] Er, well... I'd say it \ was about three minutes.

[Phoenix] That's pretty fast!

[Gumshoe] Our motto for the month \ is "get there quick."

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Detective! You will refrain \ from casually revealing \ department secrets!

[Gumshoe] Y-yessir! \ Sorry, sir!

[Karma] Do that, and you'll be able \ to look forward to your next \ salary review.

[Gumshoe] So much to look forward \ to, these days...

[Karma] This is no time for \ daydreaming! Continue!

[Gumshoe] Y-yessir!

[Gumshoe] (3) \ That's where we found \ Mr. Edgeworth.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What was Mr. Edgeworth like \ when you saw him then?

[Gumshoe] Well...

[Gumshoe] From what I saw, he looked \ pretty relaxed. Not like a \ murderer at all, really.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Detective! The court requires \ the facts, NOT your opinion!

[Karma] How many years have you \ been on the force!?

[Karma] Facts only, Detective! \ Hard, cold, objective facts!

[Gumshoe] Y-y-yessir!

[Phoenix] (Man, he's got his share \ of objections...)

[Gumshoe] (4) \ Now, I didn't suspect \ him of anything at all.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Why didn't you think he \ was suspicious?

[Gumshoe] You should know!

[Gumshoe] We have a deep, trusting \ relationship with the \ prosecutors.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Detective! The court isn't \ interested in your musings!

[Karma] "Deep"? "Trusting"? \ Poppycock!

[Karma] I've never heard so many \ flippant comments from an \ active detective on the force!

[Gumshoe] Mmph!

[Phoenix] (Detective Gumshoe doesn't \ look so good...)

[Karma] Continue! Now!

[Gumshoe] (5) \ But... the next morning, \ a body was found in the lake.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Did you find any clues \ on the body?

[Gumshoe] A single bullet was recovered \ from the body.

[Gumshoe] He was shot through the \ heart... fatally.

[] CONTINUE FOR FIRST TIME ONLY

[Karma] Judge! \ Here's the bullet...

[Karma] It didn't strike bone, so its \ shape is well preserved.

[Judge] Very well. The court accepts \ this bullet into evidence.

[] Pistol Bullet added to \ the Court Record.

[] END CROSS-EXAMINATION IF PISTOL POSSESSED

[Gumshoe] (6a) \ So we had to arrest \ Mr. Edgeworth.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] W-why is that?

[Gumshoe] Well, we found the murder \ weapon in the boat.

[Phoenix] The murder weapon...?

[Gumshoe] A pistol.

[Judge] Detective Gumshoe...

[Judge] That is a vital piece of \ information. Please revise \ your testimony.

[Gumshoe] Right! S-sorry, Your Honor.

[] Change to 6b

[Gumshoe] (6b) \ The murder weapon we found \ in the boat was decisive \ evidence.

[Phoenix] What about the pistol made \ it "decisive evidence"?

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk...

[Phoenix] (Ack! He has the same evil \ laugh as Edgeworth...)

[Gumshoe] There were fingerprints on the \ pistol found in the boat.

[Gumshoe] They were clear prints from \ Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.

[Phoenix] Wh-what!?

[] CONTINUE FOR FIRST TIME ONLY

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] So Mr. Edgeworth's finger- \ prints were found on the \ murder weapon!?

[Gumshoe] Y-yes, Your Honor.

[Karma] Judge! \ This is the weapon \ in question.

[Judge] A-accepted into evidence.

[] Pistol added to \ the Court Record.

[] END CROSS-EXAMINATION IF PISTOL BULLET POSSESSED

[Maya] Nick.

[Maya] Doesn't it seem like \ Detective Gumshoe is \ being a little vague?

[Phoenix] I bet von Karma \ is feeding him lines!

[Phoenix] His testimony's probably \ filled with landmines just \ waiting for me to press.

[Maya] What do we do?

[Phoenix] Grit our teeth and press, \ I guess. What else can we do?

[Maya] Well said, Nick! \ You're the man!

[] ...

[Karma] Members of the court...

[Karma] We now have the pistol used \ in the murder, and the bullet \ found in the body!

[Karma] Detective!

[Gumshoe] Y-y-yessir!

[Karma] Was the bullet found in the \ body fired from this pistol?

[Gumshoe] Yes. The ballistic markings on \ the bullet match the pistol.

[Judge] Hmm...

[Maya] Hey, Nick!

[Maya] What does he mean, \ "ballistic markings"?

[Karma] Shocking!

[Karma] To imagine someone here does \ not know something as basic \ as ballistic markings!

[Maya] N-Nick! He's glaring at me!

[Karma] Tsk... very well, \ I'll explain.

[Karma] Actually, Judge! \ You do it.

[Judge] Eh? M-me?

[Judge] ...

[Judge] Erm, ahem.

[Judge] Ballistic markings are like \ the "fingerprints" of a gun.

[Judge] The barrel leaves distinctive \ marks on each bullet it \ fires.

[Judge] You can examine these \ "ballistic fingerprints" to \ see which gun fired the shot.

[Judge] It's quite accurate.

[Karma] Indeed.

[Karma] This leads to one, inevitable \ conclusion: the bullet found \ in the victim's heart...

[Karma] was, without a doubt, \ fired from this pistol.

[Karma] This pistol which, as you may \ recall, was covered with the \ defendant's own fingerprints!

[Judge] O-order! Order!

[Phoenix] (This is bad...)

[Phoenix] (This makes it look like \ Edgeworth did it!)

[Karma] Well, Judge?

[Judge] I'd say it's almost \ decisive, yes.

[Judge] Honestly, I could declare \ a verdict at this point.

[Judge] However...

[Karma] You wish to hear the witness \ speak, no doubt.

[Karma] Very well.

[Karma] I am somewhat fatigued, and \ so I will take a brief break.

[Karma] I will call my witness \ after the recess.

[Karma] Which will last ten minutes.

[Karma] Judge!

[Judge] Y-yes?

[Karma] What are you doing? \ A ten minute recess! Now!

[Judge] B-but, wait, I...

[Karma] Just bang your flimsy gavel \ and get on with it, man!

[Judge] Y-yes!

[Judge] Ahem. This court will take \ a ten minute recess.

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green December 26, 11:09 AM \ District Court \ Defendant Lobby No. 2

[Phoenix] Edgeworth! \ What's going on here!?

[Phoenix] Your fingerprints were \ on the murder weapon!

[Edgeworth] Uh... hmm...

[Phoenix] And that foggy photo \ makes one thing clear...

[Phoenix] The only one who could have \ shot that man was the person \ in the photo!

[Edgeworth] True...

[Phoenix] Was that you in the boat?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Yes. It was me.

[Phoenix] What!?

[Edgeworth] But... you must believe \ me. I didn't shoot him.

[Phoenix] Th-then who did!?

[Edgeworth] I... don't know.

[Phoenix] You don't know!? \ Weren't you right there!?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] I heard a gunshot from \ very close by.

[Edgeworth] Then... the other man \ fell from the boat.

[Edgeworth] I can't say why, but...

[Edgeworth] I thought, at the time, that \ he had shot himself!

[Phoenix] Y-you mean it was a suicide!?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] That's the only explanation \ I can come up with.

[Phoenix] Huh... \ (How am I going to convince \ anyone of that!?)

[Phoenix] Say, Maya?

[Maya] Huh? Wh-what?

[Phoenix] Any progress with Mia?

[Maya] Oh...

[Maya] Sorry. \ It's no good.

[Phoenix] Ugh...

[Maya] I know...

[Maya] I'm no good for anything, \ am I, Nick?

[Maya] If I can't call my sister, \ I might as well not be \ here, right?

***No, I need you here**********************

[Phoenix] No, of course not, \ I need you here!

[Phoenix] I can see you're always \ trying to help out.

[Phoenix] Even if you don't actually \ help... it's the thought that \ counts, right?

[Maya] It's okay Nick, you don't \ have to make me feel better.

********************************************

***Yeah, you're useless*********************

[Phoenix] Um, well, actually...

[Phoenix] (You don't know law, you \ don't have any trial \ experience or techniques...)

[Phoenix] (Yeah, you're pretty much \ useless... but I can't say \ that!)

[Maya] It's okay Nick. You don't have \ to say anything. Your face \ said it for you.

[Phoenix] (Whoops!) \ N-no, o-of course we... \ I'm sorry.

[Maya] It's okay, Nick.

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Maya] I don't know anything \ about trials, or defense...

[Maya] What's more, I'm a spirit \ medium who can't even \ contact spirits...

[Phoenix] Aww, everyone has their \ off days!

[Phoenix] I mean, I've just been \ getting lucky lately...

[Phoenix] But you never know when \ my luck is going to run out!

[Maya] Really...?

[Edgeworth] W-w-whoa! Wright!

[Edgeworth] Don't jinx this case any \ worse than it already is!

[Edgeworth] It's bad for my heart...

[Phoenix] Oh? Oh! S-sorry... \ (Whoops!)

[] ...

[Judge] Court is back in session.

[Judge] Mr. von Karma, call \ your witness.

[Karma] Yes.

[Karma] Will Ms. Lotta Hart \ take the stand?

[] ...

[Karma] Lotta Hart, you are a \ research student at a \ university?

[Lotta] That I am.

[Karma] Good. Begin by telling us \ what you saw the night of \ the incident.

[Karma] And don't add anything \ trivial or subjective.

[Karma] Understand?

[Lotta] ...

[Lotta] Y'all need to learn \ some manners.

[Karma] UNDERSTAND?

[Lotta] Y-yeah, I understand, \ I understand!

[Judge] Er... very well. \ Your testimony, please.

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Witness's Account --

[Lotta] (1) \ It was Christmas Eve, just \ after midnight, I reckon.

[Lotta] (2) \ I was in my car.

[Lotta] (3) \ I heard this "bang" \ come up from the lake.

[Lotta] (4) \ When I looked out the \ window, I saw two gents \ in a boat.

[Lotta] (5) \ Then there was another \ "bang"...

[Lotta] (6) \ There wasn't nary a thing \ on the lake but that boat.

[] ...

[Karma] Enough.

[Lotta] Huh?

[Karma] Judge!

[Karma] She happened to take \ a photo of the incident!

[Karma] This is that photo. \ Accept it as evidence.

[Judge] W-well! This is a surprise!

[Judge] This looks like... the very \ moment of the murder!

[Judge] O-Order! I will remove you \ from the court if I do not \ have order immediately!

[Karma] As the witness testified, \ she looked at the lake when \ she heard the shot.

[Karma] There were no other boats \ on that lake!

[Karma] So, the man in the boat with \ the victim must have been the \ one who shot him...

[Karma] Yes. It was the defendant, \ Miles Edgeworth!!!

[Judge] Order! Order! Order...! \ I will have order!

[Karma] ...

[Karma] Well, Judge?

[Judge] The evidence is... decisive.

[Judge] I have very little doubt \ about this case.

[Judge] Very well, this court finds \ the defendant...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] W-wait! Your Honor!

[Phoenix] I haven't cross-examined \ the witness yet!

[Karma] A cross-examination?

[Karma] We have photographic proof! \ What question can there \ possibly be!?

[Karma] This photo is worth a thousand \ words... and they all read \ "guilty"!

[Karma] You lose.

[Karma] Or...

[Karma] Do you claim to have found \ a contradiction in her \ testimony!?

[Phoenix] ...!

[Karma] Very well. If you have to, you \ may cross-examine the witness.

[Karma] You will only flounder and \ ask meaningless questions!

[Karma] You will fail to find \ anything!

[Karma] And then, I will have you \ held in contempt of court!

[Maya] Uh, Nick... contempt...?

[Phoenix] "Contempt of court," you know?

[Maya] I... guess I understand.

[Maya] Well... what are you \ going to do?

[Maya] Do you really think there \ was a contradiction with the \ facts in her testimony?

***I think there was************************

[Phoenix] I... think I noticed \ one little thing...

[Maya] Wow, I'm impressed, Nick! \ I didn't notice anything!

[Maya] Right! Let's take him on!

[Phoenix] Y-yeah... \ (I got a bad feeling \ about this...)

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***I think there wasn't*********************

[Phoenix] Honestly, I found nothing.

[Maya] I dunno, I thought her \ testimony was strange.

[Maya] She was so vague \ about everything!

[Phoenix] I bet von Karma probably fed \ her her lines.

[Maya] But...

[Maya] But if you don't cross- \ examine her, the judge \ will...

[Phoenix] He'll bang down that "flimsy \ gavel" of his and declare \ Edgeworth guilty.

[Maya] I guess we'll just \ have to bluff it.

[Phoenix] But if we mess up... \ contempt of court.

[Maya] Hey, if we lose we'll \ be held in public \ contempt!

[Phoenix] Er... right.

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] I understand... \ I will cross-examine \ the witness!

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk... \ Very well!

[Judge] I pray for your sake this \ isn't a waste of time.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Witness's Account --

[Lotta] (1) \ It was Christmas Eve, just \ after midnight, I reckon.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "Just after midnight," \ you say?

[Phoenix] In other words, it was no \ longer Christmas Eve... \ but Christmas Day!

[Lotta] Huh? Uh, yeah, well, yes.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] I know you want to find \ contradictions, but really!

[Phoenix] Mmmph.

[Judge] I hope your next contradiction \ is a little more relevant \ to the trial.

[Judge] Witness, continue your \ testimony.

[Lotta] (2) \ I was in my car.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Why were you camping there, \ anyway?

[Lotta] I'm a research student at my \ university.

[Lotta] I was taking pictures to \ use in my research.

[Phoenix] (What research? This all \ sounds suspicious...)

***Press further****************************

[Phoenix] Ms. Hart.

[Phoenix] Could you be more specific \ about your "research"?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] What does the witness's motive \ in camping by the lake have \ to do with this case!?

[Karma] The answer is "nothing"! \ I object to this line \ of questioning!

[Karma] Objection sustained!

[Judge] W-w-wait, now, I'm the \ one who says that!

[Karma] Well, then say it already!

[Judge] Objection sustained.

[Phoenix] (Thanks for nothing, \ Your Honor...)

********************************************

***Hold back********************************

[Phoenix] (I think I'll let that \ one slide for now.)

********************************************

[Lotta] (3) \ I heard this "bang" \ come up from the lake.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So, you weren't looking at \ the lake at the time?

[Lotta] Nope.

[Lotta] I looked after I heard \ that noise.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] She's said that already!

[Karma] I asked you to find \ "contradictions"!

[Karma] Not leisurely chat with the \ witness!

[Phoenix] (Urk...)

[Lotta] (4) \ When I looked out the \ window, I saw two gents \ in a boat.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Could you clearly \ see the two men?

[Lotta] Just look at the picture! \ Clear enough for you?

[Phoenix] (Uh oh...)

***Press further****************************

[Phoenix] Wait a second!

[Phoenix] I wasn't asking you \ about the photo!

[Phoenix] I was asking if \ YOU saw the two men!

[Lotta] Uh, yeah, well, of course...

[Karma] The witness has testified \ that she saw them! There's \ also a photo!

[Karma] You'd best look elsewhere for \ your precious contradictions!

[Phoenix] (He jumped in quick... \ He's hiding something!)

********************************************

***Hold back********************************

[Phoenix] (I think I'd best \ let that one slide...)

********************************************

[Lotta] (5) \ Then there was another \ "bang"...

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Were you watching the \ very moment the shot \ rang out?

[Lotta] Well, yeah, sure...

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] You're asking meaningless \ questions! Meaningless!

[Karma] "Contradictions," Mr. Wright. \ Not meaningless babble!

[Phoenix] (von Karma, I think \ I hate you.)

[Phoenix] (He's trying to keep me \ from talking to the \ witness...)

[Phoenix] (To what end...?)

[Lotta] (6) \ There wasn't nary a thing \ on the lake but that boat.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Are you sure about that?

[Lotta] Yeah, sure as a country \ gal can be!

[Phoenix] (That sounds pretty sure.)

***Press further****************************

[Phoenix] How come you're so sure?

[Lotta] Well, heck, I scanned \ the whole lake.

[Phoenix] ("Scanned the whole lake"?)

[Phoenix] (It almost sounds like she \ was more interested in the \ lake than the boat...)

[Phoenix] Ms. Hart... you--

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Mr. Wright!

[Karma] The witness has answered \ the question in full.

[Phoenix] Mmph!

[Karma] No need for further questions! \ Objection sustained!

[Judge] U-uh, that's what I'm...

[Karma] Sustained!

[Judge] Y-yes, of course.

[Phoenix] (Oh great...)

[Phoenix] (What am I supposed \ to do now?)

********************************************

***Hold back********************************

[Phoenix] (Lotta seems pretty \ sure of herself.)

[Phoenix] (I'd better not forge \ blindly ahead here.)

[Phoenix] (Still... this whole thing \ stinks.)

[Phoenix] (Th-there weren't any \ contradictions in there!)

[Maya] Sorry, Nick. If only \ my sister were here...

[] END AFTER PRESSING ON MOST OF TESTIMONY

[] ...

[Judge] Enough!

[Judge] I think we've heard all we \ need to hear, Mr. Wright.

[Judge] It seems you are unable to \ find a contradiction in the \ testimony worth noting.

[Phoenix] B-but, Your Honor!

[Karma] You keep your promise!

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Judge] I am afraid that I will \ have to penalize any \ further outbursts...

[Judge] By holding you in \ contempt of court!

[Karma] And if that happens, \ you'll have to leave the \ courtroom immediately!

[Karma] Understood...?

[Phoenix] Uh... uh huh.

[Maya] Nick...!

[Maya] Lotta's testimony is \ fishy, Nick! Real fishy!

[Phoenix] I... know what you mean.

[Phoenix] But...

[Phoenix] If I can't say anything, \ what can I do?

[Judge] I believe we've covered \ the evidence sufficiently \ to make a decision.

[Karma] Then, pass your judgment!

[Judge] Very well.

[Judge] Mr. Miles Edgeworth, \ please take the stand.

[???] *HOLD IT!*

[Judge] Wh-who was that!?

[Maya] It... was me.

[Phoenix] (Maya!)

[Judge] I-is something wrong? \ D-do you need to use \ the facilities?

[Maya] No, I do not!

[Maya] Lotta Hart!

[Maya] Your testimony stinks!

[Maya] It's unclear whether you \ were actually looking at \ the lake!

[Maya] It's highly doubtful that \ you actually saw \ Mr. Edgeworth!

[Maya] Tell us the truth!

[Maya] This is a matter \ of life or death!

[Lotta] ...!

[Maya] Lotta!

[Maya] Did you really clearly \ see Mr. Edgeworth that night!?

[Maya] Did you see him fire \ that pistol!?

[Judge] You will stand down!

[Judge] The court does not acknowledge \ the defense's outburst!

[Maya] Answer me, Lotta!

[Lotta] What's the big idea, \ treating me like some \ kind of criminal!?

[Lotta] I saw him! I swear it! \ I saw Edgeworth...

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Enough!

[Karma] Judge...

[Karma] Declare the defense in \ contempt of court!

[Judge] Y-yes... yes, of course.

[Judge] I'm sorry, but you \ WERE warned.

[Judge] Guard! Escort Mr. Wright \ out of the courtroom!

[Judge] He is in contempt of \ court, and must leave.

[Phoenix] (No...)

[Phoenix] (No...!)

[] ...

[] Wait!

[Maya] I-I was the one who made \ the outburst, Your Honor!

[Maya] Nick is innocent!

[Karma] Hah!

[Karma] What's the difference?

[Lotta] The photo I took...?

[Phoenix] The very same.

[Phoenix] There's something I want \ you to see in this photo... \ it's quite clearly visible.

[Phoenix] The fog, Ms. Hart.

[Lotta] So... so?

[Phoenix] This picture was taken \ with professional, high \ quality film, correct?

[Phoenix] Yet even it could not \ capture the faces of \ the men on the boat!

[Phoenix] Yet you claim you \ saw Mr. Edgeworth!

[Phoenix] How!?

[Lotta] Whut!? Wha--!

[Judge] Mr. Wright has a point!

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] That's why I told her \ not to say that in her \ testimony! Please!

[Phoenix] Yet, now she has said \ it, Mr. von Karma.

[Phoenix] How could you possibly \ see Mr. Edgeworth!? \ Explain yourself!

[Judge] Ms. Hart.

[Lotta] What!

[Judge] Could you see the \ defendant that night?

[Lotta] O-of course! I said I could \ and I meant I could!

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- How Edgeworth Was Seen --

[Lotta] (1) \ Yer right. It was a cold \ night, and the fog was \ thick as grits.

[Lotta] (2) \ So, once I was finished \ setting up my camera, I \ got back in the car.

[Lotta] (3) \ Still, I brought my \ binoculars with me.

[Lotta] (4) \ When I heard that noise out \ on the lake, I looked with \ my binoculars.

[Lotta] See? No problem!

[Judge] Hmm... You used binoculars?

[Judge] Very well. \ You may begin your cross- \ examination, Mr. Wright.

[Lotta] Now, just hold your \ horses for a second!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Your "camera"...?

[Lotta] Yeah. \ It's got an automatic...

[Lotta] (3a) \ Still, I brought my \ binoculars with me.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "Binoculars"?

[Lotta] Yeah, binoculars.

[Phoenix] Yesterday, you mentioned \ that you were out looking \ for shooting stars, correct?

[Lotta] Well... yeah.

[Phoenix] Wouldn't you need a telescope, \ not binoculars, for that?

[Lotta] ...!

[Phoenix] I've got doubts about your \ camera, too!

[Phoenix] Was that really to take \ pictures of meteor showers?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] The camera is irrelevant \ to this case!

[Phoenix] You can't say that \ for certain!

[Judge] Hmm... Mr. Wright.

[Judge] Is the camera really \ relevant to this case?

[Judge] If you believe it is, \ you may continue with \ this line of questioning.

[Karma] But know this!

[Phoenix] And here, this article \ about "Gourdy."

[Phoenix] According to this article...

[Phoenix] Gourdy made a loud noise \ when it emerged!

[Phoenix] Well?

[Phoenix] You were trying to \ photograph Gourdy, \ weren't you!

[Phoenx] That's why you had set \ your camera to respond \ to loud noises!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] I see...

[Judge] I, too, thought it \ was a little strange.

[Phoenix] (Yeah, sure!)

[Phoenix] Well, Ms. Hart?

[Phoenix] You were camping there to \ try and take a photo of \ Gourdy, weren't you?

[Lotta] ...

[Lotta] Yeah.

[Lotta] Not bad. Are all you \ lawyers that smart?

[Lotta] So, smart boy, I was down \ there trying to photograph \ Gourdy, you got me.

[Lotta] So what?

[Phoenix] Huh...?

[Lotta] That don't change \ what I saw, does it?

[Karma] Exactly!

[Karma] What you just used several \ precious minutes of our time \ to prove...

[Karma] is nothing more than that the \ witness is an idiot who thinks \ monsters exist!

[Lotta] H-hey!

[Karma] But, as she so succinctly \ said, so what!?

[Karma] It changes nothing!

[Phoenix] (Not true!)

[Phoenix] (You were hiding the whole \ thing about Gourdy for \ some reason, I know it!)

[Phoenix] (But what could it have \ been...?)

[Phoenix] (Whatever it is, I'm getting \ to the bottom of this!)

[Lotta] Ms. Hart.

[Judge] Why did you hide the fact \ that you were searching for \ Gourdy from the court?

[Judge] Please revise your testimony.

[Lotta] ...

[Lotta] Right. Fine, I'll testify. \ It won't change nothing, \ though.

[Phoenix] (Something will change... \ it has to!)

[Phoenix] (And I'm going to spot it!)

[Karma] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Lotta's New Testimony --

[Lotta] (1) \ Actually, I'm not a research \ student at a university.

[Lotta] (2) \ I'm an investigative \ photographer.

[Lotta] (3) \ Imagine what a scoop it'd be \ if I got a picture of that \ monster!

[Lotta] (4) \ That's why I was camping out \ by the lake.

[Lotta] (5) \ But, that's all I was \ hiding.

[Lotta] (6) \ When I heard the "bang" \ I looked right straight \ out at that lake.

[Lotta] (7) \ There wasn't much else to \ look at, so I just watched \ that boat the whole time.

[Lotta] (8) \ Then I saw a flash, near one \ of the men's hands, and I \ heard another gunshot.

[Lotta] I was looking right at that \ boat, the whole time, cross \ my heart and hope to fry.

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm... \ Well, Mr. Wright. You may \ cross-examine the witness.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] The witness's testimony \ is unchanged from before!

[Kamra] Whether she is a research \ student or a photographer \ has no bearing on this case!

[Karma] There is no need to waste more \ of our time with another \ pointless cross-examination!

[Judge] Er... hmm.

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] I claim the defense's right \ to cross-examine the witness, \ Your Honor!

[Phoenix] (von Karma's up to something, \ I know it!)

[Phoenix] (He doesn't want me to cross- \ examine her because... why? \ Was there a contradiction?)

[Judge] Very well. \ You may begin the \ cross-examination.

[Judge] You seem sure of yourself, \ you must have something in \ mind.

[Karma] Hah! That would be a first!

[Phoenix] (Hah hah, very funny.)

[Judge] You understand that this \ is your last chance at a \ cross-examination, Mr. Wright?

[Judge] If there is no problem with \ the testimony this time, we \ will let the witness leave.

[Judge] I will announce my verdict \ at that time, Mr. Wright.

[Judge] Understood?

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Lotta's New Testimony --

[Lotta] (1) \ Actually, I'm not a research \ student at a university.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Then what manner of person \ are you!?

[Lotta] I'm not sure I'm high- \ falutin' enough to be \ called a "manner" of anything.

[Lotta] (2) \ I'm an investigative \ photographer.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] An "investigative \ photographer"?

[Lotta] Yep.

[Lotta] You get your photo, and sell \ it to the press. It's that \ kind of business.

[Lotta] Hey, I was taking pictures \ at my sister's graduation \ last year...

[Lotta] N' guess what!

[Phoenix] Umm... what?

[Lotta] There was a yoofoh just \ a' hanging in the sky!

[Phoenix] A "yoofoh"...?

[Lotta] You know, an "Unidentified \ Flying Object"? A yoofoh!

[Lotta] That's when I had sort \ of a revelation.

[Lotta] I knew I should become \ an investigative photographer!

[Phoenix] I... I see.

[Phoenix] (Kind of a shaky basis \ for a career...)

[Lotta] (3) \ Imagine what a scoop it'd be \ if I got a picture of that \ monster!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Is "Gourdy" really all \ that newsworthy?

[Lotta] Heck yeah! They even \ had him up on the TV!

[Phoenix] (I'm not sure that appearing \ on the local news "rumor of \ the month" show qualifies.)

[Phoenix] (Last month's show was \ "Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn \ Hill," I believe.)

[Lotta] Hey! They also had a picture \ of him in the newspaper! \ For real!

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Judge] This is one fight I do \ not believe you can win.

[Judge] Let's keep moving, shall we?

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[Lotta] (4) \ That's why I was camping out \ by the lake.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] That's why you put the \ automatic sensor on \ your camera?

[Lotta] Yep. Borrowed it from a \ friend at a university.

[Lotta] It analyzes every sound it \ picks up, and when it gets \ a "bang!"...

[Phoenix] It snaps a shot.

[Lotta] Yep.

[Phoenix] So, how many pictures \ has it taken so far?

[Lotta] The only time the camera \ triggered was that night.

[Phoenix] (Hmm...)

[Lotta] (5) \ But, that's all I was \ hiding.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] I think it's time you told us \ why you felt you had to hide \ your true purpose at the lake.

[Lotta] Heck, if word got out what \ I was up to, the lake'd be \ swarmin' with competitors!

[Phoenix] Competitors...?

[Lotta] Yeah! Second-rate shutterbugs \ trying to steal my scoop!

[Phoenix] Ah...

[Phoenix] Is that the only reason you \ were hiding the truth?

[Lotta] W-well, actually...

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Mr. Wright! I'll not have you \ asking questions with no \ relevance to this case!!!

[Phoenix] (Whatever you say, von Karma. \ I know you told her to keep \ quiet.)

[Lotta] (6) \ When I heard the "bang" \ I looked right straight \ out at that lake.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Exactly what sort of \ sound was it?

[Lotta] Well, I never heard one before \ so I can't say for sure... but \ it sounded like a gunshot.

[Lotta] It was a lot sharper a sound \ than I would have expected.

[Phoenix] (Hmm...)

[Lotta] (7) \ There wasn't much else to \ look at, so I just watched \ that boat the whole time.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] There wasn't "much else \ to look at"?

[Lotta] Yep.

[Phoenix] (I dunno. If she heard a \ bang... and she thought \ Gourdy was out there...)

[Phoenix] (I kind of doubt she'd waste \ any time looking at a boat.)

[Lotta] What? What did I do now? \ What're you giving me that \ look for?

[Phoenix] (Definitely suspicious... \ Maybe it's time for some \ evidence...)

[Karma] Witness! Continue.

[Lotta] Hold your hushpuppies, \ pops, I'm getting there.

[Lotta] (8) \ Then I saw a flash, near one \ of the men's hands, and I \ heard another gunshot.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Was there nothing on the lake \ but the boat at that time?

[Lotta] Huh? Wait, so you're thinking \ maybe he was shot from some \ other place?

[Lotta] I don't think so, nope.

[Lotta] The lake was smooth as glass, \ and nobody was on the shore, \ neither.

[Phoenix] (Hmm...)

[Phoenix] (I'd better find some sort \ of contradiction in this \ testimony...)

[Phoenix] (I won't be able to beat \ von Karma any other way...)

[Phoenix] (There has to be something!)

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Ms. Hart!

[Phoenix] Were you REALLY looking \ at that boat!?

[Lotta] W-what's with you!? \ Course I was looking at it!

[Lotta] It was the only thing out \ there! Any normal person'd \ be looking at it!

[Phoenix] I agree, any normal person \ would.

[Phoenix] But you are far from normal!

[Lotta] Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step \ over here and say that!?

[Phoenix] You were camping at the lake \ to take a picture of Gourdy!

[Phoenix] Think about it--

[Phoenix] What would you do if you \ heard a loud noise?

[Phoenix] You'd be scanning the lake \ for any sign of Gourdy, \ that's what!

[Phoenix] You wouldn't give the \ boat a second thought!

[Lotta] Aah!

[Judge] Order! Continue, Mr. Wright!

[Phoenix] You testified that you were \ watching the boat through \ binoculars!

[Phoenix] However, you wouldn't need \ binoculars to watch that boat!

[Phoenix] You needed them to search for \ Gourdy... and that's what you \ were doing!

[Lotta] ...!

[Lotta] ...

[Lotta] ...

[Phoenix] Well!?

[Lotta] Hmph...

[Lotta] Well, now that y'all mention \ it...

[Lotta] I did sort of take my \ binoculars and kind of \ scan the lake a bit...

[Lotta] I mean, Gourdy might be \ out there, n' all...

[Judge] M-Ms. Hart!

[Judge] A-are you saying that \ you were NOT watching \ the boat, then?

[Lotta] ...

[Lotta] S-sorry, y'all.

[Lotta] I wasn't fibbing, really.


[Lotta] I was, just... I thought \ y'know, I could be witness \ to a murder n' all!

[Lotta] I kinda got excited.

[Lotta] I was sure I was watching \ that boat... till now.

[Judge] ...

[Judge] This... this is totally \ uncalled for--

[Lotta] B-but hey!

[Lotta] You got the photograph! \ You got proof!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Still, we can't see who \ is shooting who in this.

[Lotta] Right! Right!

[Lotta] That's why I took \ this photo n'...

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Witness... That's enough.

[Karma] You've had a long day. \ Shut your pie-hole.

[Lotta] Sh-shut my what!?

[Phoenix] (What was she going to say?)

[Phoenix] (She took the photo... and \ what?)

[Phoenix] (Wait a second...)

[] ...

[Gumshoe] She even had a photograph \ to prove it.

[Phoenix] But you really can't tell \ from the photo who is \ shooting.

[Gumshoe] That's why she said she's \ going to enlarge the photo.

[Gumshoe] She said "it'll drop the \ quality a mite, but should \ let us see who's who!"

[] ...

[Phoenix] (She enlarged that photo!)

[Phoenix] (Why won't von Karma \ let her show it?)

[Phoenix] (I've got a hunch!)

[Phoenix] (I bet that enlarged photo \ shows something bad for \ von Karma!)

[Phoenix] (This is my chance!)

[Phoenix] (If I'm wrong, though, it'll \ mean prison for Edgeworth... \ or worse.)

[Phoenix] (What should I do!?)

[Phoenix] Ms. Hart! \ Look at this photograph.

[Phoenix] You enlarged this photograph, \ did you not?

[Lotta] Y-yeah! I did!

[Phoenix] Why has that enlargement not \ been presented to the court!?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] B-because it does not \ exist!

[Lotta] What're y'all talking about!?

[Lotta] You were the one who told \ me not to show it in court \ in the first place!

[Lotta] You old fool!

[Judge] What's the meaning of this, \ Mr. von Karma!

[Karma] Er... erm...

[Phoenix] Ms. Hart!

[Phoenix] Show the photo to the court! \ Show us the enlargement!

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] The prosecution objects \ to the submission of this \ evidence!

[Judge] Objection... denied.

[Judge] The witness will show the \ enlargement to the court.

[Lotta] Here it is.

[Judge] Hmm. We still cannot see \ who is firing in this.

[Judge] It could be the defendant... \ or maybe it's not.

[Judge] Regardless, I'll accept this \ as evidence.

[] Lake Photo added to \ the Court Record.

[Karma] Happy now, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Hmm... \ (There has to be something!)

[Karma] You asked for the enlargement, \ you got the enlargement.

[Karma] And little good it has done \ any of us!

[Karma] That's why I requested she \ not show it!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] I suppose this means that \ the cross-examination...

[Karma] Is over! Obviously!

[Judge] Then, I would like to close \ the cross-examination of \ Ms. Lotta Hart.

[Karma] And none too soon. That was \ a flagrant waste of my time.

[Judge] Mr. von Karma, do you \ have anything to add?

[Karma] I stated everything I needed \ to when this trial began.

[Karma] Decisive evidence.

[Karma] A decisive witness.

[Karma] What else could possibly \ be required?

[Judge] Nothing, of course.

[Judge] Then, I believe it is time \ for me to declare my verdict.

[] RETURN TO COURT RECORD

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] The evidence is clear.

[Phoenix] The man in this photograph \ is holding that pistol in \ his left hand.

[Phoenix] However!

[Phoenix] The prints on the murder \ weapon were from Edgeworth's \ "right hand"!

[Phoenix] Ergo!

[Phoenix] The man shooting the pistol \ in this photograph...

[Phoenix] Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!

[] ...

[Judge] Now that everyone in the \ courtroom has quieted down...

[Judge] I would like to reconvene \ this court of law!

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[Judge] You have given us definitive \ proof today.

[Judge] We now know that it was not \ Mr. Edgeworth who fired the \ pistol that night.

[Judge] However...

[Judge] This leaves us with a rather \ large problem.

[Judge] If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do \ it, then who shot our victim?

[Karma] Precisely!

[Karma] As we have seen, there were \ no other people on the lake \ that night!

[Karma] Who but the defendant \ could have shot the victim!?

***Ms. Hart*********************************

[Phoenix] Who else but the witness, \ Ms. Lotta Hart!

[] RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

[Phoenix] There is only one explanation \ remaining!

[Phoenix] The man who shot the victim \ was none other than... the \ victim himself!!!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] So... you are saying that the \ victim committed suicide?

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor. I can think \ of no other explanation.

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Indeed, that does seem to be \ the only remaining option.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] I'm so very, very sorry, \ Mr. Wright.

[Karma] But suicide is out \ of the question.

[Phoenix] Wh-what!?

[Karma] An examination of the victim's \ wound reveals the distance \ at which he was shot.

[Phoenix] The... distance?

[Karma] The victim was clearly shot \ from further than a meter \ away!

[Phoenix] A meter! Th-that's three feet!

[Karma] There is no way it could \ have been suicide!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] Mr. von Karma! Are you sure \ of the accuracy of your data!?

[Karma] Of course! I had already \ considered the possibility \ of suicide, you see.

[] Autopsy Report updated \ in the Court Record.

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] I see.

[Judge] Very well, allow me to \ state my opinion.

[Judge] Considering the situation, \ the shooter had to be the \ defendant, Mr. Edgeworth.

[Judge] However!

[Judge] The prints on the gun reveal \ that the shooter was not \ Mr. Edgeworth.

[Judge] This is a conundrum.

[Judge] Therefore, I would like to \ suspend proceedings for this \ trial for the day.

[Judge] The court orders the defense \ and the prosecution to further \ investigate this matter.

[Judge] Understood?

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[Karma] ...

[Judge] That is all. \ The court is adjourned.

[Phoenix] Hey!

[Phoenix] Don't you have anything \ to say!?

[Edgeworth] No. I have yet to be declared \ innocent, Wright.

[Phoenix] Well, yeah, but...

[Phoenix] What happened out there \ on that lake, anyway!?

[Phoenix] If he didn't commit \ suicide, then who...?

[Phoenix] The shooter was about \ a meter away, too!

[Edgeworth] ... \ W-what? \ Don't give me that look!

[Edgeworth] I did not kill him!

[Phoenix] I was just kidding around.

[Edgeworth] Hmph.

[Phoenix] Look...

[Phoenix] I'm going to go \ check on Maya.

[Edgeworth] Oh...

[Edgeworth] Wright.

[Phoenix] What?

[Edgeworth] Tell her something for me.

[Phoenix] What?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Tell...

[Edgeworth] Tell her to watch what \ she says in court.

[Edgeworth] That's all.

[Phoenix] (Yeah, I'm sure she'll be \ happy to hear you say that, \ Edgeworth. Jerk!)

[] ...

[Phoenix] I requisitioned a transcript \ of Lotta's entire testimony.

[Phoenix] I thought it might give me \ some ammunition for the trial \ tomorrow.

[Phoenix] Of course she didn't see \ the shooter...

[Phoenix] Uh huh.

[Maya] Huh...

[Maya] It's nice and big... but you \ can't really see the faces \ any clearer, can you?

***Present Misty Fey's Photo****************

[Maya] My... mother.

[Maya] I want to see Gourdy, too!

[Phoenix] If he really exists.

[Maya] Well, I'd say a photograph \ is pretty good proof!

[Maya] So the markings on this bullet \ and the barrel of the pistol \ matched?

[Maya] So, which one of these are \ the ballistic markings?

[Maya] Mr. Edgeworth's prints are \ on this pistol, aren't they?

[Maya] You can pay for me, okay?

[Phoenix] (Not following protocol...?)

[Phoenix] (I bet he wouldn't help them \ build the case against \ Edgeworth...)

[] ...

***Examine chief****************************

[Phoenix] This must be the chief \ of the detectives here.

[Phoenix] He's glued to his computer \ screen.

[Chief] Wha...!? \ Rook to Bishop 7...

[Chief] Checkmate!? \ I don't believe it!

[Phoenix] (He must be playing chess \ on the computer...)

********************************************

***Examine detective************************

[Phoenix] That must be one of the \ detectives.

[Phoenix] He's mumbling something \ to himself.

[Police] "Don't do anything \ rash! Why jump...?"

[Police] "...You have every \ reason to live!"

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] He must be doing image \ training for talking down \ a potential suicide.

[] MOVE TO: Gourd Lake Entrance

[] ...

[] December 26 \ Gourd Lake Park \ Entrance

[Phoenix] There are fewer than there \ were yesterday, but the cops \ are still around in the park.

[Phoenix] I wonder if Detective \ Gumshoe is here today?

[] ...

***Examine sign*****************************

[Phoenix] The sign says "Gourd Lake \ Nature Park."

[Phoenix] This place is full of families \ picnicking on the weekend.

[Phoenix] It's a little cold for \ picnicking these days, \ though.

********************************************

***Examine trees****************************

[Phoenix] I feel winter's chill from the \ bare leaf trees today...

[Phoenix] There's a lot of trees here. \ I guess that's why they call \ it a "nature park."

[Phoenix] It's quite pretty when the \ cherry trees along the \ lakeside blossom in spring.

[Phoenix] Today... it's just cold.

********************************************

[] MOVE TO: Gourd Lake Public Beach

[] ...

[] December 26 \ Gourd Lake \ Public Beach

[Phoenix] Haven't seen Larry around \ today at all.

[Phoenix] Probably off paying through \ the nose on a date with \ the lovely Kiyance...

[] ...

***Examine lake*****************************

[Phoenix] The famous Gourd Lake...

[Phoenix] Its green waters stretch \ out on both sides...

[Phoenix] It's a pretty big lake, \ really.

********************************************

***Examine benches**************************

[Phoenix] A lineup of plastic benches.

[Phoenix] I guess the idea is you \ buy a dog and eat it here.

[Phoenix] I doubt anyone would sit here \ and eat on a day like this.

[Phoenix] Except maybe Maya, if \ she had a Samurai Dog.

********************************************

[] MOVE TO: Boat Rental Shop

[] ...

[] December 26 \ Boat Rental Shop

[Phoenix] (Looks like the boat rental \ shop is closed today, too.)

[] ...

***Examine boat rental shop*****************

[Phoenix] A small boat rental shop.

[Phoenix] Doesn't look like anyone \ is around.

[Phoenix] They're probably closed \ because of the murder.

********************************************

***Examine boats****************************

[Phoenix] There are some boats floating \ at the dock.

[Phoenix] The murder took place in \ a boat from this dock...

[Phoenix] Apparently, the police took \ away the actual boat that \ was used that night.

[Phoenix] Indeed, there's space for \ one more boat at the dock.

[Phoenix] Hey, Detective Gumshoe!

[Gumshoe] Hey, pal!

[Gumshoe] The trial today, it, er...

[Gumshoe] ...

[Phoenix] Yes? What about the trial?

[Gumshoe] Well, I was going to say \ "good show," but it wasn't \ really all that...

[Gumshoe] Though you did save Edgeworth, \ I guess...

[Gumshoe] I just wasn't sure how \ to thank you... you know?

[Phoenix] Er... thanks.

[] ...

***Examine SUV******************************

[Phoenix] I don't think Lotta takes \ very good care of her SUV.

[Phoenix] It's covered with dents.

[Phoenix] I can't believe anyone would \ drive their car down here.

********************************************

***Examine sign*****************************

[Phoenix] The sign says "No Camping."

[Phoenix] Funny place to pick to \ pitch your tent.

********************************************

***Examine firepit**************************

[Phoenix] I wonder why she brought \ a camping cooker with her?

[Phoenix] There's a convenience store \ right up the street...

[Phoenix] I guess she wanted to get \ into the outdoor spirit.

********************************************

***Examine camera***************************

[Phoenix] Lotta's camera is staring \ out at the lake, as usual.

[Phoenix] Even a novice like me can tell \ that camera must cost a pretty \ penny.

[Phoenix] I hope she doesn't leave it \ out here to get stolen.

********************************************

***Present Attorney's Badge*****************

[Gumshoe] I think it's a little early \ for you to be proudly waving \ that thing around.

[Gumshoe] You can be proud of yourself \ when you get Mr. Edgeworth \ declared innocent, pal!

********************************************

***Present Lotta's Camera*******************

[Gumshoe] That woman really took us \ for a ride, didn't she?

[Gumshoe] Claiming she was a witness \ to a murder and all...

[Phoenix] Still, if it weren't for \ her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth \ wouldn't have made it today.

[Gumshoe] Oh, huh, really?

[Phoenix] (Umm... you were at the trial, \ weren't you, Detective?)

********************************************

***Present Robert's Autopsy Report**********

[Gumshoe] Robert Hammond...

[Gumshoe] He was the defense attorney \ in the DL-6 Incident trial.

[Gumshoe] He's the one who got the \ sole suspect off the hook.

[Gumshoe] I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth \ thinks of him. Not much, \ I'd wager.

********************************************

***Present Lake Photo***********************

[Gumshoe] I don't care who you are, \ no one can tell me that \ that's Mr. Edgeworth!

[Gumshoe] I mean, come on, it doesn't \ look like him at all!

[Phoenix] But Edgeworth has admitted \ he was on the boat.

[Gumshoe] Then he's the one being \ shot, then!

[Phoenix] He seemed fine in court \ today...

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] Details, pal, details!

[Gumshoe] Whose side are you on, anyway?

[Phoenix] (All I'm saying is we have to \ respect the evidence...)

********************************************

***Present Pistol Bullet********************

[Gumshoe] Yep, it was fired from the \ murder weapon, without a \ doubt.

[Phoenix] From a meter away... so it \ would have to have been \ from someone else on the boat.

[Gumshoe] Hmm...

[Phoenix] What do you make of this, \ Detective Gumshoe?

[Gumshoe] Hey, making something of \ things is your job!

[Phoenix] Er... right.

[Phoenix] (Since when do lawyers have \ to do detectives' work for \ them!?)

********************************************

***Present Pistol***************************

[Gumshoe] Maybe you should tell me \ why Mr. Edgeworth's prints \ were on the weapon, pal.

[Phoenix] Huh? How should I know!?

********************************************

***Present Lotta's Deposition***************

[Gumshoe] Now, she heard two gunshots, \ right?

[Phoenix] But wait... \ Look at the Court Record!

[Phoenix] According to this, the \ murder weapon was fired \ three times!

[Gumshoe] What!? How's that possible!?

[Phoenix] Where was the third shot \ fired?

[Gumshoe] I wonder...

[Gumshoe] Maybe it was a practice \ shot or something?

********************************************

***Present other****************************

[Gumshoe] Sorry to disappoint you, pal.

[Gumshoe] I'm drawing a blank.

********************************************

***Talk about "Tomorrow's trial"************

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe?

[Phoenix] Any idea what strategy \ von Karma is planning \ for tomorrow?

[Gumshoe] It sounds like he's bringing \ in another witness!

[Phoenix] Another witness!?

[Phoenix] Oh, right, he said something \ about that in the trial \ today...

[] -------...

[Karma] There were two witnesses!

[] -------...

[Phoenix] I was wondering who that \ other witness was!

[Phoenix] Er... who was it?

[Gumshoe] S... sorry, pal.

[Gumshoe] As much as I'd like to, \ I'm not at liberty to \ divulge that information.

[Phoenix] (Right...)

********************************************

***Talk about "Prosecutor Edgeworth"********

[Phoenix] Oh, right... I wanted to \ ask you something about \ Edgeworth.

[Gumshoe] What's up?

[Phoenix] Is he afraid of earthquakes? \ I never heard anything about \ that before.

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk \ about himself too much, see.

[Gumshoe] But there's one thing that's \ clear as day...

[Gumshoe] Him hating crime the way \ he does...

[Gumshoe] And him becoming a lawyer...

[Gumshoe] And him being scared of \ earthquakes...

[Gumshoe] It all started with that \ incident.

[Phoenix] The DL-6 Incident?

[Gumshoe] Yep, that's the one.

[Gumshoe] Fifteen years ago... when \ he saw his father shot \ before his very eyes!

[Gumshoe] He still feels the pain now, \ you can see it in his eyes.

********************************************

***Talk about "Maya Fey"********************

[Phoenix] I wanted to talk to you \ about Maya Fey...

[Gumshoe] Huh? She's not out on bail \ yet?

[Gumshoe] That's strange.

[Gumshoe] I told 'em to let her go \ as soon as they had their \ report written up.

[Gumshoe] Man...

[Gumshoe] I don't know what would have \ happened in that courtroom \ today if it weren't for her.

[Gumshoe] Seeing her getting dragged \ out by the bailiff...

[Gumshoe] I'll be honest with you, pal. \ I shed a tear or two.

[Gumshoe] Edgeworth, he was so moved \ I saw his lip trembling.

[Phoenix] Really!? \ (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)

[Gumshoe] He was really grateful for \ what she did, you know.

********************************************

[] AFTER TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING

[Gumshoe] I'm going to head back \ to the station.

[Gumshoe] I'll get the report on Maya \ and get her out of there \ as soon as I can.

[Phoenix] Thank you.

[Phoenix] Oh, wait!

[Phoenix] Umm... I was wondering, how \ much is bail going to be?

[Gumshoe] Don't worry about that.

[Gumshoe] Mr. Edgeworth is posting \ the whole amount.

[Phoenix] What? Edgeworth...?

[Gumshoe] Didn't I tell you?

[Gumshoe] He's grateful to her \ for what she did.

[Gumshoe] Alright, pal. Well don't \ forget to go pick her \ up, okay?

[Phoenix] (Hmm...)

[Phoenix] (Maybe I can get Edgeworth \ to pay this month's rent, \ too...)

[Maya] Hey, Nick! \ You finally came!

[Maya] They just finished the \ paperwork, I'm free to go.

[Phoenix] Free at last, eh?

[Maya] Those interrogators were \ really mean!

[Maya] They were like "okay, what \ did you do THIS time?"

[Maya] Like I was some kind of \ criminal! Can you believe it?

[Phoenix] Well, they let you out in \ the end, didn't they?

[Maya] Mmm...

[Maya] Oh, that reminds me... \ Thanks for bail.

[Phoenix] Thank Edgeworth.

[Maya] Huh?

[Phoenix] He posted bail for you.

[Phoenix] Said he was grateful \ for what you did.

[Maya] Mr. Edgeworth did that...?

[Maya] ...

[Maya] I have to make it up to him!

[Maya] We've got to win this case, \ Nick!

[] ...

***Talk about "What to do"******************

[Phoenix] What do you think \ we should do next?

[Maya] We're kind of lacking \ in the clues department.

[Maya] We could go to the park \ and look for Gourdy.

[Phoenix] ...

[Maya] I-I was kidding!

[Phoenix] Still, if there are any clues \ out there, the park's as good \ a bet as any.

[Phoenix] What do you say? \ Shall we head down there?

[Maya] Sure!

********************************************

***Talk about "Any ideas"*******************

[Phoenix] Have you noticed anything \ lately?

[Maya] Hmm...

[Maya] You know, I did notice \ one thing while I was here \ in detention.

[Maya] It's really pretty comfortable \ here. It's warm, and they \ keep it very clean.

[Phoenix] I meant have you noticed \ anything about the case...?

[Maya] Well... \ Not much more than that, no.

[Phoenix] (She's probably still upset \ about Mia. I should leave \ her alone.)

********************************************

[] MOVE TO: Wright & Co.Law Offices

[] ...

[Maya] Ahh! Fresh air! I gotta say, \ freedom feels great.

[Phoenix] Behave yourself in the \ courtroom tomorrow, okay?

[Maya] Heh heh heh. \ Misbehaving's much more fun.

[Phoenix] It's not going to be so much \ fun when Edgeworth refuses to \ pay your bail again.

[Maya] ...

[Maya] Right. I'll behave.

[Phoenix] (Oh dear...)

[] ...

***Present anything*************************

[Maya] Don't waste time showing \ me things! We have to get \ cracking on this case!

[Maya] You know the enemy has more \ tricks up his sleeve! He's \ bringing in another witness!

********************************************

***Talk about "What to do"******************

[Phoenix] Well, what should we do?

[Maya] I don't know! I've been in \ detention this whole time.

[Maya] I think I'll let you decide \ what we should do. Deal?

********************************************

***Talk about "Any ideas"*******************

[Phoenix] Well? Any thoughts you \ want to share?

[Maya] Well, I was in detention \ all day.

[Maya] I think I'd like more \ time to think.

[Phoenix] (Poor Maya, she probably \ thought about Mia the whole \ time she was in there...)

[Phoenix] Guess so...

[] MOVE TO: Gourd Lake Entrance

[] ...

[] December 26 \ Gourd Lake Park \ Entrance

[Maya] There aren't many cops \ around today, are there?

[Phoenix] They're probably back at the \ precinct, working up the \ case against Edgeworth.

[Maya] Mmm...

[Lotta] Hey y'all!

[Maya] Hey, it's Lotta!

[Lotta] Y'all really did it \ today...

[Phoenix] Wh-what did we do now?

[Lotta] Naw, I'm not complaining!

[Lotta] See, I did a little thinking. \ A little... self-reflection, \ you might say.

[Lotta] I realized that bein' a \ witness is a mighty big \ responsibility.

[Lotta] But I just went up there \ and started blabbing any \ old thing that came to mind.

[Phoenix] Lotta...

[Lotta] So, you see, I want to \ make it up to y'all.

[Phoenix] "Make it up"...?

[] ...

***Present Lotta's Camera*******************

[Lotta] I'm thinking I should up \ the sensitivity of my \ camera mic.

[Lotta] Y'all just be sure y'all don't \ sneeze or nothing when you're \ in my part of the woods!

[Phoenix] Right...

********************************************

***Present Lake Photo***********************

[Lotta] I'm glad I did that \ enlargement.

[Phoenix] No kidding.

[Phoenix] If we didn't have that, \ Edgeworth would be in \ prison now, or worse!

[Maya] There's never a lack of drama \ when you're on a case, is \ there, Nick?

[Lotta] What, are you always on the \ verge of horrible failure \ like this!?

[Phoenix] Umm...

[Lotta] Careful or the stress'll \ send you to an early grave.

[Phoenix] (Thanks for the cheerful \ message of support!)

********************************************

***Present Gourdy Article*******************

[Maya] Umm... uh... \ You know, I was wondering...

[Lotta] Yeah?

[Maya] What if you get a picture \ of Gourdy...

[Maya] and it turns out like \ this enlargement did?

[Lotta] Y'all crazy!?

[Lotta] A blurry picture like this \ doesn't make a hit story!

[Lotta] I need a picture that screams \ "I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!"

[Lotta] I can't turn something like \ this into the paper! What kind \ of a fool do y'all think I am?

[Phoenix] (The kind of fool that would \ turn a blurry picture in as \ evidence in a murder trial?)

[Phoenix] (Not to mention claiming \ she saw something she \ didn't see!)

********************************************

[Lotta] Yep, I'd have to say I know \ exactly squat about that.

[Phoenix] (It's painfully easy to know \ when something doesn't catch \ Lotta's interest...)

********************************************

***Talk about "Today's trial"***************

[Phoenix] What did you think of \ the trial?

[Lotta] To be honest, I was doin' \ it half just to say I'd \ been a witness...

[Lotta] Even though I didn't \ really see anything.

[Lotta] I kinda convinced myself \ I had though...

[Lotta] I'm sorry, I know I caused \ y'all a lot of trouble.

[Maya] Well, memory is a tricky, \ vague little thing.

[Lotta] Yeah, I sure know that now.

[Lotta] I'll be fine the next time \ I witness a murder!

[Maya] Right!

********************************************

***Talk about "Gourdy"**********************

[Phoenix] What about Gourdy?

[Lotta] Right!

[Lotta] Well, the way I figure, the \ trial's only stoking the \ flames of Gourdy fever!

[Maya] All right, Lotta! \ You go, girl!

[Maya] I wish I could be an \ investigative photographer \ too!

[Phoenix] Lotta, what do you \ mean by "making it up \ to us"?

[Lotta] Well, ya see...

[Lotta] Actually, I got a bit \ of information for you.

[Maya] What!?

[Lotta] That von Karma didn't want \ me to say nothin' about it.

[Maya] Wh-what information!?

[Lotta] Now we're getting to \ the heart of it!

[Lotta] See, I reckoned we might \ be able to do ourselved \ a little "exchange."

[Phoenix] E-"exchange"?

[Phoenix] Umm...

[Phoenix] I thought this was to \ "make it up to us"...?

[Lotta] Right!

[Lotta] I propose a little exchange, \ to make it up to you!

[Phoenix] ...

[Lotta] Information don't come cheap, \ my friend!

[Maya] Uh...

[Maya] It reminds me of the \ "War of the Eyeglasses"!

[Butz] That's weird.

[Butz] I don't think he was \ ever like that in school.

[Gumshoe] What's up? You look \ out of sorts.

[Gumshoe] Wait... you didn't go and do \ something that's going to hurt \ Mr. Edgeworth's case again!

[Phoenix] What do you mean, "again"!?

[Gumshoe] Whatever, have a seat, pal.

[Gumshoe] I'm here for you if you \ need anything. Besides \ money, that is.

[Phoenix] He must be doing image \ training for making arrests.

[Phoenix] How is the investigation \ proceeding?

[Gumshoe] It's not, really.

[Gumshoe] We have another meeting \ coming up...

[Gumshoe] We're supposed to talk about \ Mr. Edgeworth's motive...

[Maya] His motive?

[Gumshoe] See, Mr. Edgeworth's father \ died in the DL-6 Incident...

[Gumshoe] And the guy who got the lone \ suspect declared innocent was \ the victim in this case...

[Gumshoe] Robert Hammond.

[Gumshoe] They're saying that's why \ Mr. Edgeworth shot him.

[Maya] H-huh!?

[Gumshoe] I'll loan you one of our \ newest secret weapons for \ finding evidence!

[Maya] Really!?

[Gumshoe] You can take whichever one \ you like!

********************************************

[Gumshoe] Hold on now, everything in \ due time. First, let me \ show 'em to you!

[Gumshoe] These are our best and \ brightest!

[Gumshoe] Introducing Secret Weapon \ No. 1: "Missile"!

[Maya] M-M-Missile?

[Gumshoe] He's a K-9 police dog, \ still in training!

[Gumshoe] Missile! Missile! \ Here, boy...

[Missile] Woof.

[Gumshoe] Here he is.

[Maya] Hey, he's cute!

[Maya] Look, Nick! Cute dog!

[Phoenix] (A cute dog...)

[Phoenix] (And this will help \ us... how?)

[Missile] Woof.

[Gumshoe] Next, Secret Weapon No. 2... \ A fishing pole!

[Gumshoe] Here, this is my own \ personal pole.

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe... \ we're looking for \ a monster...

[Gumshoe] Yeah!

[Phoenix] How are we supposed to \ catch a whole sea monster \ with a fishing pole!?

[Gumshoe] Never know 'til you try, pal!

[Phoenix] ...!

[Gumshoe] Okay, this next one \ is the last one.

[Phoenix] (No, please, I'm already \ overwhelmed by our choices.)

[Gumshoe] Secret Weapon No. 3! \ A metal detector!

[Gumshoe] Here.

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe... we're \ looking for something alive.

[Gumshoe] Right!

[Phoenix] How are we supposed to find \ it with a metal detector!?

[Gumshoe] Hey, you never know! It might \ have been eating soda cans!

[Gumshoe] Well, which will it be!?

[Maya] Umm...

[Maya] I can't make up my mind, Nick. \ They all seem so perfect!

[Phoenix] I can't make up my mind, \ either... for the totally \ opposite reason.

[Phoenix] (Oh well, I suppose it can't \ hurt to borrow one of them.)

[Maya] Do you like fishing?

[Gumshoe] I've never gone.

[Gumshoe] I've never used it, actually.

********************************************

***Present Metal Detector*******************

[Gumshoe] As you can see, it's a \ metal detector.

[Phoenix] Apparently, it made a pretty \ loud "bang" when it flew...

[Lotta] A "bang"...?

[Phoenix] The tank, along with the still \ deflated Samurai fell into \ the lake.

[Phoenix] At the same time...

[Phoenix] A couple was taking a \ photograph of the lake.

[Phoenix] This photo!

[Maya] Wait...

[Maya] So... you're saying that \ Gourdy...

[Maya] Is really the Steel Samurai!?

[Lotta] ...

[Lotta] ...

[Lotta] Well, that's a fine way \ to ruin a gal's dreams.

[Phoenix] I'm sorry, Lotta.

[Lotta] Nah, it's okay, you win.

[Lotta] I'll give you your info, \ like I promised.

[Maya] Poor Lotta...

********************************************

***Talk about "Case information"************

[Phoenix] So, tell us this "information" \ you have.

[Lotta] A promise is a promise, \ I guess...

[Lotta] I overheard the cops around \ here saying something about \ the witness tomorrow...

[Lotta] They said he's the caretaker \ of the boat rental place up \ the path here.

[Maya] Boat rental...?

[Maya] There's someone there? \ I mean, it looks so deserted.

[Lotta] Just an old guy, living \ all by himself.

[Lotta] Y'all should go check \ it out.

[Maya] Thanks, Lotta! We will!

[Maya] Let's get cracking, Nick!

[Lotta] Hold on.

[Phoenix] Something else?

[Lotta] Yeah... the night of the \ murder.

[Lotta] My camera clicked \ twice, you know.

[Maya] ...!

[Maya] Wait... so you have another \ photo?

[Lotta] Well...

[Lotta] Yeah, but there's nothing \ in it at all. Just the lake.

[Lotta] I figured it wouldn't be \ much use as evidence, so \ I kept it to myself.

[Lotta] Well, it might not be \ helpful at all, but...

[Lotta] Here, take it.

[] Second Lake Photo added \ to the Court Record.

[Lotta] Bye now. \ Y'all take care.

[Lotta] Time for me to pack \ up and leave.

[Maya] ...

[Maya] Poor Lotta...

[Phoenix] It's all Larry's fault.

[Phoenix] The legend still lives on, \ I guess.

[Maya] The "legend"...?

[Phoenix] Yeah, the legend of Larry, \ familiar to all who know him \ for any length of time...

[Phoenix] "When something smells, \ it's usually the Butz."

[Maya] Hmm.

[Maya] Someone should whip that \ Butz into shape.

[Maya] Hey, Nick!

[Maya] This is the boat shop that \ Lotta was talking about!

[Maya] N-Nick... you handle this.

[Phoenix] Uh, I think I'll leave this \ one up to you, Maya.

[Uncle] Meg!

[Maya] Y-yes!?

[Uncle] Finally made up \ your mind, have you?

[Maya] M-my mind?

[Uncle] You'll run the pasta \ shop when I'm gone?

[Maya] P-pasta?

[Uncle] Glad to hear it, \ glad to hear it!

[Uncle] You make your old man \ proud.

[Uncle] When you kids left the house, \ I didn't know what to think.

[Uncle] How'm I supposed to keep this \ place running, an old man like \ me?

[Uncle] Polly! \ The kids are home!

[Parrot] "Hello! Hello!" \ *squawk*

[Maya] N-Nick! \ What was that!?

[Phoenix] A parrot... the one \ on that perch.

[Uncle] Keith!

[Phoenix] Y-yes!?

[Uncle] I leave the "Wet Noodle" \ in your capable hands, sonny.

[Maya] N-Nick? What's the \ "Wet Noodle"?

[Phoenix] Um, based on the available \ evidence, I'd say it's the \ name of his pasta shop.

[Uncle] That's a relief, isn't \ it, Polly?

[Parrot] "Hello! Hello!" \ *squawk*

[Uncle] Ayup...

[Uncle] ...

[Uncle] *Zzzzz*

[Maya] He fell asleep...

[Maya] Her name?

[Uncle] Polly! \ How ya been!?

[Parrot] "Hello! Hello!" \ *squawk*

[Uncle] See?

[Maya] Neat! So the parrot's \ name is "Polly"!

[] Parrot added to \ the Court Record.

[Maya] Too bad all she can \ say is "hello"...

***Examine table****************************

[Maya] Look, Nick, he has an \ electric blanket on his \ table! Looks warm!

[Maya] That's a great idea, we \ should do that at the office.

[Phoenix] And what, talk about murders?

[Maya] Aw, you're a party pooper, \ Nick!

********************************************

***Examine pictures of fish*****************

[Phoenix] Wow, there're lots of \ various fish in Gourd \ Lake, aren't there!

[Maya] ...?

[Maya] Something's funny, Nick.

[Maya] All these fish are saltwater \ fish.

[Uncle] Meg!

[Maya] Y-yes!

[Uncle] You know the best pasta's \ always been made west of \ the Rockies, don't you?

[Phoenix] R-right, of course. \ Everybody knows that.

[Maya] Nick...?

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Maya] How long do we have to \ keep up this all-in-the- \ family charade?

[Phoenix] (We're not leaving until \ we find out what that is.)

********************************************

***Talk about "The boat rental shop"********

[Uncle] *Zzzzz*

[Phoenix] Umm... this is a boat \ rental shop, right?

[Uncle] What're you talking about!?

[Uncle] This here's the palace of \ pasta, the "Wet Noodle"!

[Uncle] Though, now that you mention \ it, we haven't gotten many \ orders for spaghetti lately.

[Uncle] All the kids come up and \ say "You dude, we wanna ride \ in one of your boats!"

[Uncle] That's why I keep them \ boats out there.

[Uncle] Youngsters these days... \ Darned if I understand 'em!

[Phoenix] I'm pretty confused myself.

[Maya] Nick... \ This isn't going anywhere.

[Phoenix] But this old man is the \ witness tomorrow, right?

[Phoenix] We've got to find some way \ of getting information out \ of him!

********************************************

***Present other****************************

[Uncle] *Zzzzz*

[Uncle] Now, listen here, Keith.

[Uncle] Remember that tricolor \ pasta we were talking about?

[Uncle] That a lawyer's badge?

[Phoenix] Y-yes, it is!

[Uncle] ...

[Uncle] I get it.

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Uncle] Ayup... I got you figured \ out now!

[Uncle] You're not Keith!

[Maya] Please, mister...

[Uncle] Alright, I'll help.

[Uncle] But, on one condition.

[Maya] What's that?

[Uncle] You too, Meg!

[Maya] Y-yes!?

[Uncle] Heh heh heh... you bring \ a tear to your old man's \ eye, you know.

[Uncle] Now, what was that you \ wanted to know? \ Speak up, Polly!

[Maya] Wow, he has a television \ in here, too.

[Uncle] Ayup. \ Don't work, though.

[Maya] Really?

[Uncle] I picked it up from the \ dump, after all. It figures \ that it doesn't work.

[Phoenix] Then... why do you keep it?

[Uncle] I don't know. It just \ looks right there.

[Uncle] In the summer, I replace \ it with a mini-fridge.

[Maya] A broken mini-fridge?

[Uncle] Of course. I got that from \ the dump, too.

[Uncle] Nobody in their right \ mind would throw away \ a good cooler.

[Uncle] He was wearin' this tattered \ old coat. Got himself some \ whiskers growing out his face.

[Maya] Do you know who that \ old man is, Detective?

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] Actually... I don't.

[Gumshoe] He's a bit of an odd bird... \ I haven't been able to get \ a straight answer out of him.

[Gumshoe] I decided first that he wasn't \ persuasive enough to stand \ and testify as a witness.

[Gumshoe] That's why we called \ Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday.

[Gumshoe] As for who he is...

[Gumshoe] We have absolutely no idea.

[Maya] Hmm... sounds suspicious!

[Gumshoe] Hmm...

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe, \ please, help us...

[Phoenix] That was when Edgeworth's \ father died.

[Phoenix] I can't help but think that \ it has something to do with \ this current case.

[Gumshoe] ...

[Gumshoe] To tell the truth, I don't \ know much about DL-6 either.

[Gumshoe] Mr. Edgeworth forbade us \ from reading the file.

[Gumshoe] So... I'm afraid I can't \ show them to you, either, pal.

[Maya] What!?

[Gumshoe] However...

[Gumshoe] If you can convince me somehow \ that the DL-6 Incident is \ related to this case...

[Gumshoe] Well, I guess I'd consider \ opening the file up.

[Phoenix] (Fifteen years ago... both \ me and Edgeworth were nine \ years old.)

[Phoenix] (We were almost through with \ fourth grade when he suddenly \ transferred.)

[Maya] Nick! \ I found out where the file is!

***Examine shelves on left******************

[Phoenix] Here are files of colleced \ case reports.

[Phoenix] There's quite a large \ volume of reports here.

[Maya] Wow... these are all \ case reports!?

[Phoenix] Yeah. It's like a graveyard \ of police cases.

[Maya] I guess my sister's case \ report is in here too... \ quietly gathering dust.

********************************************

***Examine shelves in back******************

[Phoenix] There are shelves stuffed \ with case files in the back \ of the room, too.

[Phoenix] Forgotten cases, rotting \ away for eternity...

[Maya] Nick, let's get what we \ need and get out of here.

[Maya] All this dust is getting \ to me!

********************************************

***Examine glass case***********************

[Phoenix] It looks like there are files \ inside that glass case.

[Phoenix] The case is so dusty I can't \ see what's inside.

[Maya] Nick... it's locked.

********************************************

***Present anything*************************

[Maya] Let's just hurry up \ and read these files!

[Maya] This place is so dusty, \ I want to finish up and \ get out of here...

********************************************

***Talk about "The case summary"************

[Phoenix] Well, first I have to get \ a handle on the main facts... \ like a summary.

[Maya] Right.

[Maya] Summary... summary... \ Found it!

[Maya] Here you go.

[Phoenix] December 28... 2001.

[Maya] That's exactly 15 years \ ago from the day after \ tomorrow!

[Phoenix] (So in two days, the case \ is closed...)

[Phoenix] The incident took place in \ the elevator of the district \ court.

[Maya] What!?

[Maya] Is this the same district \ court where we're holding \ the trial now!?

[Phoenix] Looks like it.

[Phoenix] There was a large earthquake \ at 2:00 PM on that day.

[Phoenix] Part of the court building \ collapsed, and all of the \ lights went out.

[Maya] Wow... that was some \ earthquake!

[Phoenix] At the time, three people \ were trapped in the elevator.

[Phoenix] It took five hours \ for them to be rescued...

[Phoenix] Five hours!

[Maya] That would be scary like \ that, in the dark!

[Phoenix] There was a lack of oxygen \ in the elevator, and the \ survivors were unconscious.

[Maya] The survivors...?

[Phoenix] One of the three in the \ elevator had been shot... \ in the heart.

[Maya] That was Mr. Edgeworth's \ father... wasn't it.

[Phoenix] (He said that his father \ was shot before his very \ eyes...)

[Phoenix] (So Miles Edgeworth was one \ of the other passengers in \ that elevator.)

********************************************

***Talk about "Victim data"*****************

[Phoenix] Do you have data on the \ victim... Edgeworth's father?

[Maya] Yeah, hold on...

[Maya] Victim... victim... \ Here! Found it!

[Phoenix] Gregory Edgeworth, 35, \ defense attorney. If he were \ still alive, he'd be 50.

[Phoenix] He had lost that day's case \ in court, and got in the \ elevator with his son, Miles.

[Maya] "Miles"...!

[Phoenix] Miles Edgeworth, of course.

[Maya] So he was on the elevator \ with his father!

[Phoenix] From the angle of the bullet \ and other evidence, it could \ not have been a suicide...

[Phoenix] The murder weapon, a pistol, \ was found in the elevator.

[Phoenix] The pistol had been fired \ two times.

[Phoenix] (Where have I heard \ that before...?)

[Phoenix] (Huh...! It sounds just \ like this current case! \ What's going on here?)

********************************************

***Talk about "Suspect data"****************

[Phoenix] Got any data on the suspect \ in there?

[Maya] Hmm... that would be the guy \ that my mom got arrested.

[Maya] Hold on... this is it.

[Phoenix] The man arrested as a suspect \ in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi?

[Phoenix] He was a clerk in the court, \ apparently.

[Maya] So he must have been the \ third person in the elevator.

[Maya] Well, then he had to have \ done it!

[Phoenix] But... he was found innocent. \ Thanks to his defense lawyer, \ Robert Hammond.

[Maya] Hammond... the victim \ in our case!

[Phoenix] Right.

[Phoenix] The suspect, Mr. Yogi, was \ oxygen deprived... so much \ so he had brain damage.

[Phoenix] He lost all memory of being \ in the elevator.

[Phoenix] After he was declared \ innocent, he disappeared.

[Maya] Hmm... where could Yogi \ have gone to, I wonder?

[Phoenix] (He may be closer than \ we think...)

********************************************

[] AFTER TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING

[Phoenix] I guess I know generally \ what happened in DL-6 now.

[Phoenix] I still don't know what \ sort of impact the whole \ thing had on Edgeworth...

[Maya] Nick.

[Maya] Are we going to take the \ whole file? There's too \ much! We'll never get it out.

[Phoenix] Y-you're right.

[Phoenix] How about we just take \ what we think we'll need...

[] DL-6 Case File added \ to the Court Record.

[Phoenix] Right.

[Phoenix] That's probably all we'll \ be able to find here.

[Phoenix] Now, all that's left \ is the trial tomorrow...

[Phoenix] I wonder how "Dad" will do \ testifying in court...

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green December 27, 10:00 AM \ District Court \ Courtroom No. 3

[Judge] Court is now in session for \ the trial of Mr. Miles \ Edgeworth.

[Phoenix] The defense is ready, \ Your Honor.

[Karma] ...

[Karma] ...

[Judge] Very well, apparently the \ prosecution is also ready.

[Phoenix] (Who is the judge here, \ anyway!?)

[Judge] Mr. von Karma, your \ opening statement.

[Karma] ...

[Karma] ...

[Judge] Er... very well, no opening \ statements so...

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Not so fast, Judge!

[Karma] I was taking a meaningful \ pause before speaking!

[Judge] R-right, of course.

[Karma] A prediction!

[Karma] Today's trial will end \ three minutes from now!

[Judge] Order... order!

[Judge] Mr. von Karma! \ What is the meaning of \ your statement just now!?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Bah! Must you question \ everything!

[Karma] It will be over in \ three minutes! We have \ no time to waste!

[Karma] I'll call my witness now!

[Judge] R-right...

[Karma] I call my witness... my \ decisive witness to the stand!

[Phoenix] (It's that mysterious \ boat shop owner.)

[] ...

[Karma] Witness... state your \ profession.

[Uncle] Mmph... zzzz...

[Uncle] ...

[Uncle] I, er, am the proprietor \ of the restaurant the \ "Wet Noodle" at Gourd Lake.

[Karma] ...

[Uncle] And I, er, also rent boats.

[Karma] The night of the incident, \ you were in the boat rental \ shop, correct?

[Uncle] Er... ayup, yup I was.

[Karma] Please testify.

[Phoenix] (Wait a second...)

[Phoenix] (We still haven't heard \ who this old guy is!)

***Raise an objection***********************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Let it slide*****************************

[Phoenix] (On second thought, I guess \ it doesn't really matter.)

[Maya] Doesn't matter!? What are \ you thinking, Nick!?

[Maya] What if that old man had \ something to do with the \ DL-6 Incident?

[Maya] If we don't find out who \ he is, we won't be able to \ build a case here!

[Phoenix] (Hmm, she has a point.)

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Wait a minute!

[Phoenix] The witness hasn't stated \ his name yet!

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Because I did not ask him, \ Mr. Wright! Bah!

[Karma] I have predicted this trial \ will end in three minutes!

[Karma] Stop asking trivial questions \ and cooperate!

[Phoenix] (Yeah, right!)

[Judge] The witness will \ state his name.

[Uncle] Zzzz...

[Uncle] ...

[Uncle] Mmph! Well, er...

[Uncle] I'm not really sure, ayup.

[Judge] What do you mean?

[Uncle] My, er, memory...

[Karma] Your honor...

[Karma] The witness does not remember \ anything beyond the last \ several years...

[Karma] Ergo, he cannot recall \ his own name.

[Judge] Hmmm... he can't recall, \ you say?

[Karma] Yes, but the incident in \ question took place three \ days ago.

[Karma] He can testify.

[Judge] Very well.

[Judge] Let's hear his testimony \ then, shall we. Witness?

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- The Night of the Murder --

[Uncle] (1) \ It was the night of the 24th, \ just after midnight, ayup.

[Uncle] (2) \ I was in the restaurant... \ where I er... rent boats, \ as usual.

[Uncle] (3) \ Then I heard a "bang!" \ Ayup.

[Uncle] (4) \ When I looked out the \ window, I saw a boat just \ a' floating on the lake.

[Uncle] (5) \ Then I heard another "bang."

[Uncle] (6) \ Just about then the boat \ comes back to shore, and \ a man walks by my window.

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...Very well. I'd like to \ begin the cross-examination...

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] There is nothing to question \ in my witness's testimony!

[Karma] Ergo, no need for \ cross-examination!

[Karma] Besides, there are only \ 10 seconds left before \ our three minutes are up!

[Karma] Judge! Your verdict, now!

[Judge] Er... yes...

[Judge] M-Mr. Wright...?

***Cross-examine****************************

[Phoenix] What are you saying!? \ Of course I'll cross- \ examine the witness!

[Judge] Hmm... \ Very well, you may begin.

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Don't cross-examine**********************

[Phoenix] (He's right. That testimony \ sounded pretty solid.)

[Phoenix] (Maybe I should hold back.)

[Maya] B-but, Nick! You have to \ cross-examine him!

[Maya] This is your only chance to \ turn this trial around! \ Your last chance!

[Phoenix] (O-oh... right.)

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Karma] Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

[Judge] E-excuse me? \ Mr. von Karma?

[Karma] Three minutes just passed.

[Judge] I see. Well then, let's \ just take our time.

[Judge] You may cross-examine \ the witness.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- The Night of the Murder --

[Uncle] (1) \ It was the night of the 24th, \ just after midnight, ayup.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "Just after midnight," \ you say?

[Uncle] Ayup, just around then.

[Phoenix] Are you sure?

[Uncle] Pretty sure, ayup.

[Phoenix] When I talked to you \ yesterday, you were \ rather vague about the time...

[Phoenix] I'm surprised you seem so \ sure about it today.

[Uncle] ...

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] I asked him, and he \ remembered.

[Karma] Isn't that right!?

[Uncle] Zzzz...

[Uncle] D-don't glare \ at me like that...!

[Uncle] I, er... I remembered it \ clearly, I did. Ayup.

[Karma] You see? \ Continue!

[Uncle] (2) \ I was in the restaurant... \ where I er... rent boats, \ as usual.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Is there anyone who can \ verify that?

[Uncle] ...

[Uncle] Well, I guess Polly could.

[Phoenix] Th-that's not good enough \ for a court of law!

[Judge] Mr. Wright... exactly \ what's not good enough?

[Phoenix] Ah, uh, Your Honor, this \ "Polly" is a parrot.

[Judge] A... parrot?

[Uncle] Don't be so hard on \ the girl, Keithy-boy!

[Judge] Keith...?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] The prosecution concedes \ that we cannot prove the \ witness was in the shop.

[Karma] Witness... please continue.

[Uncle] (3) \ Then I heard a "bang!" \ Ayup.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] And where did the "bang" \ seem to come from?

[Uncle] From the lake, I figure.

[Karma] Are you certain?

[Uncle] A-ayup.

[Karma] Good. Continue!

[Uncle] (4) \ When I looked out the \ window, I saw a boat just \ a' floating on the lake.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Was there someone in the boat?

[Uncle] It was pretty far out \ there... I couldn't see \ clearly...

[Uncle] But I figure there was \ two men out there, ayup.

[Phoenix] But you couldn't see \ them clearly!

[Uncle] Ayup... at the time, that is.

[Phoenix] (At the time...?)

[Uncle] (5) \ Then I heard another "bang."

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So you heard two gunshots \ total?

[Uncle] Ayup.

[Phoenix] (That's what Lotta said \ in her testimony yesterday.)

[Uncle] (6) \ Just about then the boat \ comes back to shore, and \ a man walks by my window.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "By your window"?

[Uncle] Ayup, by my window. \ Right outside the window \ of my little shack.

[Phoenix] And, could you see the \ man's face?

[Uncle] Well, the fog was pretty darn \ thick, but he was right there \ in front of me. I saw him.

[Judge] This is a rather important \ detail! Please add it to \ your testimony.

[Uncle] ...

[Karma] Tsk, tsk, tsk...

[Phoenix] (I have a bad feeling \ about this...)

[] ADD PART 7

[Uncle] (7) \ That man was the defendant... \ he was saying "I can't believe \ he's dead."

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[] END CROSS-EXAMINATION

[Phoenix] (If I know von Karma, he spent \ time preparing his witness.)

[Phoenix] (I'm not going to find \ contradictions very easily \ in this testimony.)

[Phoenix] (Whew... it's tough being \ a lawyer.)

[] ...

[Phoenix] A-are you sure!?

[Uncle] ...

[Phoenix] (Uh oh!)

[Phoenix] D-Dad!

[Uncle] Dead certain, Keith!

[Uncle] He said "I can't believe \ he's dead" as he was walking \ by, too.

[Karma] Witness! Are you sure that \ the person you saw was \ Miles Edgeworth!?

[Uncle] It was him! \ That Edgeworth boy!

[Judge] ...

[Judge] This... sounds like decisive \ evidence indeed. I see no \ room for doubt.

[Phoenix] (von Karma...)

[Phoenix] (He lured me into cross- \ examining so he could set \ me up for a fall!)

[Karma] Tsk, tsk, tsk...

[Maya] N-Nick...! \ I don't like the way things \ are going here!

[Maya] Everyone in the courtroom \ is glaring at us!

[Phoenix] (I'd better act quick, or this \ trial is going to be over!)

***Raise an objection***********************

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] We proved in yesterday's court \ that it could not have been \ Edgeworth who fired that gun!

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Mr. Wright.

[Karma] Are you referring to the \ fingerprints from Edgeworth's \ right hand found on the gun,

[Karma] and the photograph showing \ a man firing with his left \ hand...?

[Phoenix] Exactly!

[Karma] That is easily explainable!

[Karma] He could have wped his \ prints after he fired!

[Karma] You are ignoring the \ truth of the matter here!

[Karma] Everything in this witness's \ testimony is true!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Wait and see what happens****************

[Phoenix] (But... how can I raise an \ objection without any proof?)

[Karma] Judge! \ There is no room for doubt \ in the witness's testimony!

[Karma] I demand that you declare \ your verdict!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Judge] Hmm...

[Phoenix] (The judge is lost in \ thought... what should I do?)

***Raise an objection***********************

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] This witness claims that \ Edgeworth said "I can't \ believe he's dead"...

[Phoenix] But his word is all we \ have!

[Phoenix] If he were telling a lie...

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Mr. Wright.

[Karma] In a court of law, the \ evidence tells all.

[Karma] Apparently, you have yet \ to realize even this \ basic fact.

[Karma] If you say is testimony \ is a lie, show us proof!

[Phoenix] Urk...

[Maya] Nick! \ Do we have evidence...?

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Wait and see what happens****************

[Phoenix] (I can't see any room \ to raise an objection...)

[Phoenix] (I'd better hold back and \ see how things develop.)

[Maya] Nick! \ We have to do something!

[Maya] If we stay quiet now, \ Mr. Edgeworth'll be \ found guilty for sure!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] It's no good! \ There's nothing I can do.

[Maya] A... are you sure?

[Phoenix] To be honest...

[Phoenix] I don't know what \ to do anymore.

[Maya] Please...

[Maya] Can you hear me, Sis? \ Please...

[Maya] We need your help... \ Nick needs you...

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk...

[Karma] Three minutes was perhaps \ too high an expectation.

[Karma] However, fifteen minutes \ isn't bad! This must be \ a new record.

[Judge] Enough! \ The witness may leave \ the stand.

[Uncle] Zzzz...

[] ...

[Judge] This court sees no reason to \ further prolong the trial.

[Judge] Nor is there any need for \ more time to decide the case \ against the defendant.

[Judge] This case is extremely clear. \ I see no room for mis- \ interpretation of the facts.

[] Phoenix \ (W-what!? No!)

[Karma] Hmph.

[Judge] This court finds the \ defendant, Mr. Miles \ Edgeworth...

[] G U I L T Y *

[Judge] The accused will surrender \ to the court immediately,

[Judge] to be held pending trial at \ a higher court within a \ month from today's date.

[Judge] That is all. \ The court is adjourned!

[] ...

[] W-w-waaaaaaait!

[Judge] Wh-who was that just now?

[] Me!!!

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Phoenix] Waaaaah!

[Phoenix] L-Larry!

[Judge] Wh-what are you doing here!?

[Butz] Listen! Y-you gotta \ listen to me!

[Butz] I... I was...

[Butz] I was there, in the park, \ the night of the murder!

[Butz] I... I wasn't sure about \ it until just yesterday.

[Butz] B-but today I remembered it!

[Judge] Remembered what?

[Butz] The gunshot!

[Butz] I heard it too!

[Judge] O-order!

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] What is the meaning of this!?

[Karma] The verdict has been decided! \ I call for adjournment!

[Judge] One moment, Mr. von Karma.

[Judge] So, you say you heard \ a gunshot?

[Butz] Yeah, I did! \ A gunshot! That night!

[Butz] I was sitting here in the \ audience, listening to the \ testimony...

[Butz] Then I realized, something he \ said was different from what \ I remember!

[Butz] A-anyhow, I can't just sit \ here and let you call \ Edgey a murderer!

[Butz] It's... \ It's just not right!

[Butz] I'll testify! \ Lemme testify!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] Well, this is the first \ time something has happened \ like this in my court.

[Judge] I'm not quite sure \ how to proceed...

[Karma] Judge! \ You've already given \ your decision!

[Karma] The trial is over!

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] This is it! \ Larry's given us one \ final chance at this!

[Phoenix] (She's right!)

[Phoenix] (If only it wasn't Larry...)

[Phoenix] (He could make things \ even worse...)

[Maya] Mr. Edgeworth was just \ declared guilty, Nick!

[Maya] It doesn't get any worse!

[Phoenix] You're right! \ Okay!

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] If there is another witness, \ it is our duty to hear him \ speak!

[Phoenix] Right here! \ Right now!

[Karma] A waste of time!

[Karma] The verdict cannot be \ overturned!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] ...

[Judge] ...

[Judge] Allow me to speak my \ opinion.

[Judge] In all court proceedings, it \ is our duty to prevent an \ inaccurate verdict.

[Judge] In order to make sure no \ mistake has been made, every \ witness should be heard!

[Karma] Wh-what is this!?

[Judge] I withdraw my previous \ verdict of "guilty"!

[Judge] Mr. von Karma!

[Judge] I order you to call this \ new witness to testify.

[Judge] Now!

[Karma] Whaaaat!

[Judge] The court will adjourn \ for a five minute recess.

[Judge] After that, we will \ hear this new witness.

[Judge] Court is adjourned!

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green December 27, 10:28 AM \ District Court \ Defendant Lobby No. 2

[Phoenix] Whew...

[Phoenix] That was too close.

[Phoenix] Sorry to keep you on the \ edge of your seat like \ that, Edgeworth.

[Edgeworth] Hmph.

[Edgeworth] I've seen worse.

[Phoenix] (Yeah right, Edgeworth. \ You're sweating bullets!)

[Phoenix] I just wonder what Larry \ plans to say in there.

[Maya] Larry was at the lake \ that night?

[Phoenix] Yes...

[Phoenix] He said he went looking \ for the Steel Samurai balloon \ that flew into the lake.

[Maya] Oh right.

[Maya] And he found the balloon \ and the air tank that night?

[Phoenix] Yeah.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Phoenix] Hey, Edgeworth.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Huh? \ You say something, Wright?

[Phoenix] Yeah, a lot of things.

[Phoenix] You seem out of it. \ What's wrong?

[Edgeworth] It... it's nothing.

[Phoenix] Hmm?

[Maya] Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? \ There's something I've \ been meaning to ask you.

[Edgeworth] What's that?

[Maya] Why are your fingerprints \ on the murder weapon?

[Edgeworth] Oh.

[Edgeworth] When he fell into \ the lake, I went into \ a daze.

[Edgeworth] I couldn't understand what \ had happened. I couldn't \ think straight.

[Edgeworth] Then I saw the pistol \ lying on the floor of \ the boat in front of me.

[Edgeworth] I picked it up without \ thinking.

[Edgeworth] I didn't have a reason, \ really.

[Maya] I see...

[Edgeworth] Wright...

[Phoenix] Yeah?

[Edgeworth] This might be our chance.

[Phoenix] Our chance?

[Edgeworth] von Karma has only ever \ run perfect trials.

[Phoenix] Perfect trials...?

[Edgeworth] Perfectly prepared witnesses, \ perfectly complete evidence.

[Edgeworth] That's the secret to \ his success.

[Edgeworth] This is the first time \ he's ever had to deal with \ something unexpected!

[Edgeworth] He has let someone he hasn't \ even talked to testify before \ the court!

[Edgeworth] And that someone... is Larry!

[Phoenix] What are you getting at?

[Edgeworth] It's likely his testimony \ will be full of holes, Wright.

[Maya] That's right, Nick!

[Maya] No ten minute trial this time! \ We'll milk this one for all \ it's worth!

[Phoenix] Hey, it was fifteen minutes! \ Fifteen! (Everything depends \ on Larry now...)

[] ...

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green December 27, 10:35 AM \ District Court \ Courtroom No. 3

[Judge] Court is now back in session.

[Judge] Witness...

[Judge] Please testify to the \ court about everything \ that you saw...

[Judge] on the night of December \ 24th.

[Butz] Right... leave it to me!

[Phoenix] (Please, Larry, don't mess \ this one up!!!)

[Pheonix] (I hate to admit it, but \ you're our last chance!)

[Karma] ...

[Phoenix] (von Karma didn't even have \ time to prep his witness.)

[Phoenix] (I just hope Edgeworth is \ right about this being \ our big break...)

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- The Night of the Murder --

[Butz] (1) \ That night, I was out \ in a boat on the lake.

[Butz] (2) \ I was looking for something, \ and I, er, found it.

[Butz] (3) \ So I quietly slipped the \ boat back in at the rental \ shop dock.

[Butz] (4) \ Then, just as I was thinking \ about going home, I heard \ this "bang"!

[Butz] (5) \ I looked out over the lake, \ but I didn't notice the boat.

[Butz] (6) \ So after I heard that single \ gunshot I went home.

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] That was an unusually vague \ testimony, even for this \ court.

[Judge] In any matter, Mr. Wright, \ you may begin your cross- \ examination.

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor...

[Maya] What's wrong, Nick?

[Phoenix] It's Larry! \ I have no idea what he's \ going to say if I press him.

[Phoenix] I'm a little scared.

[Maya] Hmm...

[Maya] Well, we've come this far. \ There's no way to go but \ forward, Nick!

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- The Night of the Murder --

[Butz] (1) \ That night, I was out \ in a boat on the lake.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] ...

[Judge] Something wrong, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] There were so many things \ wrong I don't know where \ to begin...

[Judge] Ah...

[Phoenix] Um, well, okay. First of \ all, what time was it?

[Butz] Oh, it was after 11:00 \ when I went out in the \ boat.

[Butz] But that time everyone had gone \ home for the night.

[Butz] So I waited until the \ coast was clear, so \ to speak.

[Phoenix] And why were you out \ on a boat at such a \ late hour...?

[Butz] (2) \ I was looking for something, \ and I, er, found it.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "Looking for something"...?

[Butz] Er, yeah.

[Judge] Mr. Butz, what was it \ you were looking for?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] What the witness was \ searching for is irrelevant!

[Karma] Most likely he was hunting \ for this "Gourdy"!

[Phoenix] (You know, it wouldn't \ surprise me one bit \ if that was the truth.)

[Karma] This is all irrelevant! \ Let's get it over with.

[Butz] (3) \ So I quietly slipped the \ boat back in at the rental \ shop dock.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Around what time was that?

[Butz] Uh... \ Well, let's see...

[Butz] I figure I was out searching \ for about an hour...

[Butz] I guess it was around \ 12:00. Yeah.

[Judge] You're not sure?

[Butz] Hey! Don't give me that face!

[Butz] I'm not some sort of \ human sundial, okay!?

[Phoenix] (People use watches \ these days, Larry...)

[Butz] (4) \ Then, just as I was thinking \ about going home, I heard \ this "bang"!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Where did the sound \ come from?

[Butz] Yeah, well, I wasn't \ too sure about that.

[Butz] I looked around, y'know.

[Judge] Did you look at the lake?

[Butz] Yeah, I looked.

[Butz] (5) \ I looked out over the lake, \ but I didn't notice the boat.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Wasn't there a boat \ on the lake!?

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] Well? Mr. Butz!

[Butz] Whoa, whoa.

[Butz] Everybody just calm \ down, okay?

[Butz] I mean, it was real \ foggy that night.

[Butz] I'm not sure whether \ there was a boat out \ there or not.

[Phoenix] (Oh, okay, no problem. That's \ just the MOST IMPORTANT PART \ of this case!!!)

[Karma] Hmph!

[Butz] (6) \ So after I heard that single \ gunshot I went home.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So, you only heard one "bang" \ correct?

[Butz] Yeah.

[Phoenix] (Huh.)

[Maya] Well, Nick?

[Phoenix] Hmm...

[Phoenix] It was a pretty wishy-washy \ testimony, wasn't it?

[Phoenix] I guess I should just start \ working on the contradictions.

[Maya] Sorry...

[Maya] I wish I could be more \ helpful. I wish I could call \ my sister...

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] W-wait a sec, Larry!

[Butz] Wh-what!?

[Phoenix] You only heard one \ "bang"!? You're sure!?

[Butz] That's what I said!

[Phoenix] But Ms. Lotta Hart testified \ yesterday that she heard \ two "bang"s!

[Phoenix] And the old man just now \ said the same thing!

[Phoenix] They both heard two \ gunshots that night!

[Butz] Huh?

[Phoenix] Were you even listening!?

[Phoenix] Were you paying attention at \ all to what they said?

[Butz] Yo, Nick, please!

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Butz] You know, something's been \ bothering me.

[Butz] I'm a witness, see? \ I'm like a customer here!

[Butz] So you got to treat me \ nice and stuff, okay!?

[Phoenix] ...

[Judge] Mr. Butz.

[Butz] What!?

[Judge] You only heard one gunshot? \ Are you sure?

[Butz] ...

[Butz] Umm...

[Butz] Well, to tell ya the truth... \ I'm not sure.

[Judge] Eh...?

[Phoenix] Not sure!? \ H-how could you not be sure?

[Butz] Yeah, well...

[Butz] I, uh, I might have \ missed the other gunshot.

[Butz] I was, uh, listening \ to something else...

[Phoenix] Something... else?

[Butz] My radio, dude! \ On my headphones.

[Phoenix] Whaaaaaaat!?

[Judge] Order! Order! \ And stop that booing!

[Judge] M-Mr. Butz!

[Judge] You were listening to \ a radio on earphones?

[Butz] Y-yeah! So what! \ That a crime!?

[Butz] I listen to my radio! \ Everybody listens to the \ radio! What's the big deal!?

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Mr. von Karma... your \ opinion?

[Karma] Waste of time.

[Karma] I do not accept this witness, \ nor his shoddy testimony.

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Well, Mr. Wright? \ Should he continue the \ testimony?

***That's enough****************************

[Phoenix] (No, I think I've heard \ enough. This is all too \ embarrassing...)

[Phoenix] (In fact, I think we've \ all heard enough.)

[Maya] What are you saying, Nick!?

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- What Larry Heard --

[Butz] (1) \ It's lonely, being alone \ on Christmas Eve!

[Butz] (2) \ That's why I was listening \ to an all-requests show on \ the radio, see?

[Butz] (3) \ I was listening to it \ real booming loud, like.

[Butz] (4) \ But I'm sure I heard \ that gunshot!

[Butz] (5) \ I remember exactly what \ the DJ was saying when \ I heard it, too.

[] ...

[Judge] You were listening to your \ radio... at a high volume!?

[Butz] Yeah, what's the big problem?

[Butz] Can't a man listen to his \ radio in peace? Isn't this \ a free country!?

[Phoenix] (I truly believe Larry has \ no idea what the problem \ here is.)

[Karma] Judge.

[Karma] Can you believe a word \ this witness says?

[Karma] What he heard was probably \ nothing more than a drum \ beat from the radio!

[Judge] True enough, it is difficult \ to believe this testimony.

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Wait, Your Honor!

[Phoenix] The witness said he remembers \ exactly what the DJ said when \ he heard the gunshot!

[Judge] Excuse me? \ "Dee-jay"...?

[Phoenix] An announcer... the guy who \ says things on the radio.

[Phoenix] Anyway!

[Phoenix] What this means is, when he \ heard the sound, no music \ was playing!

[Phoenix] The DH only talks between \ songs! So he could have heard \ the gunshot from the lake!

[Phoenix] I'd like to cross-examine \ the witness, Your Honor!

[Judge] V-very well, Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] (I can't believe I'm \ continuing this charade...)

[Phoenix] So, you turned on the radio?

[Butz] Right!

[Butz] I just wanted to hear \ someone's voice, y'know?

[Butz] You don't know what it's \ like out there, alone, \ on Christmas Eve! Alone!

[Phoenix] (I shouldn't have said \ anything...)

[Butz] (2) \ That's why I was listening \ to an all-requests show on \ the radio, see?

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Do you by any chance remember \ the name of the program you \ were listening to?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] This has nothing to do with \ the case, Your Honor!

[Judge] Objection sustained.

[Judge] The witness was listening \ to the radio. That is all \ we need to know.

[Judge] Tell us, Mr. Butz, how loud \ was your radio set to that \ night?

[Butz] (3) \ I was listening to it \ real booming loud, like.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Real "booming" loud?

[Butz] Yeah, y'know.

[Judge] And you had headphones on?

[Butz] Yup.

[Judge] I wouldn't think you could \ hear anything going on outside \ at all...

[Butz] (4) \ But I'm sure I heard \ that gunshot!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Can you prove that...?

[Phoenix] No... no, of course you can't.

[Butz] Nah, I can't prove it.

[Butz] But I remember that moment \ real clear.

[Butz] I mean, while I was talking \ about it, it came back real \ clear to me, y'know?

[Butz] (5) \ I remember exactly what \ the DJ was saying when \ I heard it, too.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What did he say?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Mr. Wright!

[Karma] Please cease these \ pointless questions!

[Karma] What possible good could \ knowing what a radio DJ \ said do us!?

[Judge] Indeed, Mr. von Karma \ has a point.

[Judge] I'll allow the question only \ if you see some reason why \ we should care...?

***We don't care****************************

[Phoenix] (Hmm... right.)

[Phoenix] (I don't really have a \ deep reason for asking, \ now that I think about it.)

[Phoenix] Understood, Your Honor. \ I withdraw my question.

[Judge] Continue your examination \ of the witness, then.

[Phoenix] (This is getting nowhere...)

********************************************

***We should care***************************

[Phoenix] We should care, Your Honor! \ Of course we should!

[Karma] Why?

[Phoenix] Uh.

[Phoenix] W-well, how do you know \ if we don't ask, hmm?

[Judge] Fine, very well.

[Judge] Mr. Butz, please testify \ to the court.

[Judge] What was the radio announcer \ saying when you heard the \ gunshot?

[] ADD PART 6

********************************************

[Butz] (6) \ Just when she said "Hey! \ it's almost Christmas!" I \ heard the gunshot!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Are you sure?

[Butz] Course I am!

[Butz] She had this real \ sexy voice...

[Phoenix] (Hmm... maybe von Karma was \ right. I'm not sure how \ that helped us at all.)

[Phoenix] This is the most ludicrous \ testimony I've ever heard.

[Phoenix] (But there is one \ gleaming ray of hope \ in there!)

[Phoenix] (I've got to press it \ until we get to the \ bottom of what happened!)

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Larry! Are you absolutely \ sure what you're saying \ is correct!?

[Butz] Huh? What's with the face? \ You look scary, dude.

[Butz] Hey, if you're trying \ to scare me, you better \ know I don't scare that easy!

[Judge] Is something the matter, \ Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] Did you hear what the \ witness just said?

[Phoenix] The DJ said "Hey! It's almost \ Christmas!" when he heard \ the gunshot!

[Judge] Indeed... \ And...?

[Phoenix] "Almost Christmas" means \ it wasn't Christmas!

[Phoenix] Do you realize what this \ means?

[Phoenix] When he heard the gunshot, \ it was still Christmas Eve!!!

[Judge] That would seem to be \ the case, yes...

***If Lake Photo used to object*************

[Phoenix] But he should have heard \ that gunshot after midnight!

[Phoenix] This photograph is irrefutable \ proof of this fact!

[Judge] Let's see what the time was on \ the photo taken when the gun \ triggered Ms. Hart's camera.

[Judge] < 12/25 00:15 >...! \ Fifteen minutes after \ midnight, on Christmas Day!

********************************************

***If Lotta's Deposition used to object*****

[Phoenix] But that contradicts the two \ testimonies we have heard \ so far, Your Honor!

[Phoenix] Both Ms. Hart and the old man \ said it was after midnight \ when they heard the shots!

[Phoenix] In other words...

[Phoenix] When they heard the gunshots, \ it was already Christmas!!!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] This is a clear \ contradiction, Your Honor!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] What does this mean?

[Judge] The two prior witnesses \ heard gunshots after \ midnight.

[Judge] However, this witness says \ he heard a gunshot before \ midnight...

[Karma] Judge. \ The answer is simple.

[Karma] The current witness \ is plainly mistaken.

[Karma] Just look at hm! \ Suspicious!

[Butz] Wh-whaaat!?

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Well, Mr. Wright?

[Judge] What do you think about \ Mr. Butz's claim he heard \ the gunshot before midnight?

***Larry's wrong****************************

[Phoenix] Well...

[Phoenix] I guess, it had to have \ been Larry's mistake.

[Karma] Hah!

[Judge] Very well.

[Butz] W-w-waaaaait!

[Butz] I come up here, I give \ you a riveting testimony...

[Butz] And you laugh it off \ as some kinda mistake!?

[Butz] What about me!?

[Butz] How can you call yourself \ a friend, Nick? How!?

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] Look at this photograph!

[Phoenix] This was taken by our witness \ yesterday, Ms. Lotta Hart, \ with her automatic camera.

[Phoenix] The timestamp on the photo \ reads "December 24, 11:50 PM."

[Judge] Oh yeah?

[Judge] Hmm?

[Judge] But, there's nothing on \ the lake in this picture.

[Phoenix] Your Honor.

[Phoenix] The real issue here is not \ why nothing is shown in this \ photograph.

[Phoenix] It is why this photograph \ exists at all!

[] Judge \ What do you mean?

[Phoenix] Your Honor...

[Phoenix] This photograph was taken \ by an automatic camera.

[Phoenix] That camera was set to go off \ in response to loud noises!

[Judge] Ahah!

[Phoenix] Correct!

[Phoenix] There was a loud noise on the \ lake at 11:50 PM.

[Phoenix] That is why this photograph \ was taken!

[Phoenix] In other words...

[Phoenix] When Larry heard that gunshot, \ it was most definitely \ Christmas Eve!

[Judge] Indeed, it would seem \ that is the case!

[Judge] Then... where does that \ leave us?

[Judge] Ms. Hart testified that she \ heard the gunshots after \ midnight.

[Judge] Are you claiming she \ was mistaken?

[Phoenix] Not at all, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] It is a fact that the camera \ also triggered at 15 minutes \ after midnight!

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] That night, there were two \ sets of gunshots, with a \ 25 minute pause between them!

[Judge] Why would this be...?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Don't be fooled, Judge!

[Karma] That camera was set to \ respond to "loud noises"!

[Judge] Yes?

[Karma] There is no proof that the \ "loud noise" at 11:50 was \ a gunshot!

[Karma] Why, the witness could have \ sneezed, triggering the \ camera!

[Butz] H-hey, my nose was clear \ that night, man! Clear!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Well, Mr. Wright?

[Judge] There's no turning back now.

[Judge] Can you prove that the "loud \ noise" at 11:50 PM was indeed \ a gunshot?

[Judge] Please show the court evidence \ if you have any.

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Judge] Mr. Wright...

[Judge] Is that a smirk I see?

[Phoenix] Er, Your Honor... sorry, \ I wasn't really sure about \ the evidence.

[Judge] Don't show us evidence \ you aren't confident in \ Mr. Wright!

[Judge] I'll ask you again.

[] RETURN TO COURT RECORD

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] This is my evidence.

[Judge] The... murder weapon?

[Phoenix] Something about this pistol \ was bothering me, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] Both of the witnesses who \ testified yesterday heard \ two gunshots.

[Phoenix] However, the murder weapon \ was fired three times.

[Phoenix] When, then, was the \ last shot fired?

[Phoenix] Only now have I realized \ the truth.

[Phoenix] That third shot was the shot \ Larry heard just before \ midnight!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] That would make sense \ of the evidence we've \ seen so far.

[Judge] ...

[Judge] However...

[Judge] This leaves me wondering \ exactly what did happen \ that night on the lake.

[Karma] Exactly!

[Karma] If this is true, there \ were two sets of gunshots, \ separated by 25 minutes!

[Karma] One at 11:50, another \ at 15 minutes after \ midnight!

[Karma] Why, I ask you! Why!?

[Phoenix] (Uh oh, I'd better think \ of something quick!)

[Phoenix] (...)

[Phoenix] (Wait a second...!)

[Phoenix] (Gunshots separated by \ 25 minutes...?)

[Phoenix] Aaaaaaaaaaah!

[Maya] Wh-what's wrong, Nick!?

[Phoenix] I have it! I have it!

[Maya] Huh?

[Phoenix] Remember the case with \ the Steel Samurai!?

[Maya] Huh? Yeah, of course \ I remember...

[Phoenix] The murderer in this case \ had the same idea as the \ murderer in that case!

[Maya] What do you mean?

[Phoenix] Maya!

[Maya] Yes!?

[Phoenix] If we don't figure this \ out now, we'll never overturn \ Edgeworth's guilty verdict!

[Phoenix] I've got a hunch, and I'm \ going to run with it...

[Maya] Right! \ I mean... is this safe?

[Phoenix] Safe? We've already gotten \ a guilty verdict! We have \ nothing to lose!

[Maya] ...

[Phoenix] You just watch and let me \ know if I say anything \ that sounds fishy, okay?

[Maya] Right, Nick!

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Judge] Y-yes, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] The testimony just now has \ cleared up this entire case!

[Judge] What do you mean, Mr. Wright!?

[] Karma \ Tsk tsk tsk...

[Karma] So, you've finally \ realized the truth?

[Karma] There can be no other \ murderer here than \ Miles Edgeworth himself.

[Phoenix] Wrong, von Karma!

[Phoenix] A man was shot that night, \ but it wasn't Edgeworth \ who did the shooting!

[Karma] Listen, rookie.

[Karma] Take a deep breath, and \ consider the facts.

[Karma] At the time of the murder, \ one boat was on that lake.

[Karma] This was shown by the \ witness's photograph.

[Karma] The defendant, Edgeworth, \ and the victim, Robert \ Hammond were on that boat.

[Karma] There was a gunshot fired \ on that boat, and Robert \ Hammond fell into the lake.

[Karma] The distance of the shooting \ was one meter. It couldn't \ have been suicide!

[Karma] Well?

[Karma] The guilty party has to be \ the other man on that boat!

[Judge] I admit, it is hard to imagine \ any other possibility.

[Phoenix] Yes...

[Phoenix] But this assumes that the \ victim was shot at 15 minutes \ after midnight.

[Judge] ...

[Judge] What do you mean by \ that, Mr. Wright?

[Judge] We have photographic evidence \ of the time of the shooting.

[The timestamp on the photo] says 00:15.

[Phoenix] But Larry heard a gunshot \ 25 minutes before that!

[Phoenix] Robert Hammond was killed \ then! 25 minutes before the \ shot on the lake!

[Phoenix] (That's the only way that \ Edgeworth could be innocent!)

[Judge] ...

[Karma] ...

[Karma] Mr. Wright. \ Are you quite mad?

[Karma] Explain who this is \ sitting on the boat!

***The murderer and Hammond*****************

[Phoenix] It was the murderer and \ Robert Hammond!

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] What are you saying!?

[Karma] That contradicts what you \ just told the court.

[Karma] You said that Robert Hammond \ had been killed 25 minutes \ before the gunshot!

[Phoenix] Y-yes, that's right.

[Judge] Also, might I mention...

[Judge] The defendant, Mr. Edgeworth, \ has admitted to being on that \ boat.

[Phoenix] Er, right, Your Honor. \ (Crash and burn...)

[Judge] Mr. Wright!

[Judge] Your client has already \ been declared guilty once!

[Judge] I'm going to have to \ penalize you for this \ foolishness.

[Phoenix] After the murderer killed \ Robert Hammond at 11:50...

[] Phoenix \ He assumed the guise of \ Mr. Hammond and met Edgeworth!

[Judge] Wh... What!? \ Are you serious?

[Phoenix] Yes. Edgeworth won't tell \ us why he went to the lake \ that night.

[Phoenix] However, I have a hunch.

[Phoenix] That night, Robert Hammond \ called Edgeworth to the lake.

[Phoenix] Now, Edgeworth didn't know \ Robert Hammond's face that \ well.

[Phoenix] That's why he didn't suspect \ anything when the murderer \ took Robert Hammond's place!

[Judge] ...

[Judge] I'm not sure what to \ make of all this.

[Karma] L-Ludicrous!

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Judge] Tell us the name of \ the murderer then!

[Phoenix] Y-yes, well, she did look \ sort of manly.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] I am ashamed I actually \ listened to this utter \ nonsense.

[Karma] Listen!

[Karma] You came to this conclusion \ based on a piece of evidence.

[Karma] That is, this photograph \ taken at 11:50.

[Karma] If you didn't have this \ photograph, you never would \ have made this claim!

[Karma] Correct?

[Karma] And just who was it who went \ out of her way to give you \ that piece of evidence?

[Phoenix] ...!

[Phoenix] It was... Lotta Hart.

[Karma] Why would the murderer go \ to all that trouble just to \ deliver you decisive evidence!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] I guess... they wouldn't.

[Judge] Mr. Wright. I'm going to \ penalize you for this.

[Karma] ...!

[Phoenix] The murderer is the \ caretaker of the boat \ shop, that old man!

[Phoenix] At 11:50, he was the one who \ killed Robert Hammond.

[Judge] The caretaker of the \ boat shop!?

[Judge] Wh-where did he do this!?

[Judge] There weren't any boats \ on the lake then!

[Phoenix] Then, just as he's starting \ to head for home, he hears \ a gunshot!

[Phoenix] He heard a gunshot, \ Your Honor!

[] ...

[Phoenix] That night...

[Phoenix] The caretaker of the boat \ shop called Robert Hammond \ to his shop.

[Phoenix] This was around 11:50.

[Phoenix] That was when the gunshot \ that Larry heard was fired.

[Phoenix] After that, the caretaker \ put on Robert Hammond's \ coat...

[Phoenix] He became Robert Hammond!

[Phoenix] Then he got in the boat with \ Edgeworth, and went out into \ the middle of the lake.

[Judge] Then... who fired the pistol \ on the boat, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] I believe he shot twice to \ create a witness, Your Honor.

[Judge] Create a witness...?

[Phoenix] The murderer lifts his pistol \ and fires one shot.

[Phoenix] That ensures that anyone who \ heard the shot would look \ at the lake.

[Phoenix] Indeed, Ms. Hart did exactly \ that after hearing the first gunshot.

[Phoenix] Next!

[Phoenix] The murderer waits a bit \ and he fires again.

[Phoenix] Then...

[Phoenix] The murderer jumps \ from the boat himself!

[Phoenix] Leaving the pistol \ in the boat behind him.

[Judge] ...

[Judge] I see!

[Judge] To someone looking from \ the edge of the lake...

[Judge] It would appear that one \ of the men on the boat \ had shot the other!

[Phoenix] The murderer didn't know \ about the automatic camera, \ of course.

[Phoenix] That's why he shot twice \ to draw attention to the \ boat!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Phoenix] Once you realize that, \ everything else falls \ into place!

[Phoenix] The boat shop caretaker \ swam back to his shop.

[Phoenix] Then he put Mr. Hammond's \ wet coat back on the body.

[Phoenix] And threw the body \ into the lake!

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth. \ Please take the stand.

[] ...

[Judge] Mr. Edgeworth...

[Judge] You heard what the \ defense has said?

[Edgeworth] Yes.

[Judge] Well?

[Judge] Why did you go to \ the lake that night?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] What Wright has said \ was mostly correct.

[Edgeworth] Astonishingly so, actually.

[Edgeworth] Yes...

[Edgeworth] Several days ago, I received \ a letter.

[Edgeworth] The letter was signed, \ "Robert Hammond."

[Edgeworth] He asked me to come to the \ boat shop by the lake at \ midnight on Christmas Eve.

[Edgeworth] He said he had something \ very important to discuss \ with me.

[Judge] Something important?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] I'm sorry. I can't say \ what it was.

[Judge] Hmm...

[Guard] Your Honor, sir!

[Judge] Bailiff! We are conducting a \ trial here, I ask that you \ remain quiet...

[Guard] The witness has disappeared! \ He isn't at the boat shop, \ either!

[Judge] What!?

[Guard] What should I do?

[Judge] F-find him, quickly! \ We cannot allow him \ to get away!

[] ...

[Judge] Mr. von Karma! \ Your witness has disappeared!

[Karma] ...

[Karma] A search warrant has already \ been issued.

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] It goes without saying that \ I cannot declare a verdict \ under these circumstances.

[Judge] I will extend the trial until \ tomorrow, the final day \ allowed.

[Judge] I request that the police \ department utilize all its \ forces to find that witness!

[Judge] Am I understood?

[Karma] ...

[Judge] One more thing.

[Judeg] Just who is that boat shop \ caretaker?

[Judge] I think his identity has \ become very important \ to this trial.

[Judge] I want him, and I want \ to know who he is.

[Edgeworth] A memory... of murder.

[] ---------...

[Maya] Do you really think \ Mr. Edgeworth killed...?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] I don't believe it. \ Not Edgeworth.

[Phoenix] Some painful memory has been \ troubling him recently...

[Phoenix] But he'd never take \ someone's life! Never!

[Maya] Nick...

[Butz] Yo! How's everyone doing?

[Butz] Whaddya think of my \ performance today?

[Butz] I had 'em swooning in \ the aisles! Huh, Maya?

[Maya] S-swooning? Me?

[Maya] Oh... Oh, yes. \ I do remember feeling faint.

[Butz] Right on! Tell me the \ truth, it was like love \ at first sight, right?

[Butz] Right, Nick?

[Phoenix] H-huh? Me!?

[Phoenix] I... uh, well, maybe my heart \ skipped a beat or two...

[Butz] ...

[Butz] I think you can do \ better than that!

[Butz] C'mon! I saved Edgeworth \ in there, dude! Edgey!

[Butz] You guys should be bowing \ before me! Yeah! \ Bow before your hero!

[Maya] Let's come back later.

[Phoenix] Yeah, I guess so.

[Maya] Don't forget, okay?

[] MOVE TO: Wright & Co.Law Offices

[] ...

***Talk about "Today's trial"***************

[Phoenix] Larry... \ You really helped out \ in the trial today.

[Maya] You did!

[Maya] If you weren't there, \ Larry, I'm sure Mr. Edgeworth \ would have been found guilty!

[Butz] Hah hah hah hah hah hah \ hah hah hah hah hah hah!

[Butz] But, seriously, Nick.

[Butz] That boat shop caretaker \ guy is pretty suspicious...

[Butz] But Edgey ain't off \ the hook yet!

[Maya] Way to spoil the mood, Larry.

[Butz] Hey, I'm just a guy sitting \ in the audience, you know?

[Butz] But from where I was sitting, \ Edgey seemed pretty... edgy.

[Butz] I mean, can you really \ know he's telling the \ truth about that night?

[Phoenix] ...

[Maya] Nick?

[Phoenix] I don't know.

[Phoenix] But... what I do know is...

[Phoenix] I'm going to believe in \ you two until the end.

[Butz] Us two?

[Maya] Edgeworth and... who else? \ You mean me right?

[Butz] Nah! He means me! \ Right, Nick?

[Phoenix] Yeah, you, Larry.

[Maya] Not... me?

[Maya] ...

[Maya] B-but why you, Larry!?

[Butz] Huh?

[Butz] Um, actually, yeah. \ Why me, Nick?

[Phoenix] ...

[Maya] Hmph. Enough with the \ silent treatment!

********************************************

***Talk about "Edgeworth"*******************

[Maya] Nick...

[Maya] Why do you trust Mr. Edgeworth \ so much?

[Maya] I mean, he's changed \ recently, true.

[Maya] But when we first met \ him, he was kind of a \ jerk, don't ya think?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] You didn't know him back then.

[Phoenix] Back when he wanted to \ become a defense attorney.

[Maya] Wait...

[Maya] Was that when you two were \ classmates?

[Phoenix] Yes. In grade school...

[Phoenix] They saved me... \ Miles...

[Phoenix] And Larry. \ They saved me and I'll \ never forget it.

[Phoenix] That's why I became a \ defense attorney, you know.

[Maya] Whaaaat!?

[Maya] Hey, hey, Larry. \ What's he talking about?

[Butz] Huh? Uh... um...

[Butz] Er, sorry. \ I kinda forgot.

[Maya] Hmph.

[Maya] Okay, Nick. Out with it! \ I'm going to hear this \ story today, and that's final!

[Phoenix] Okay, okay.

[Phoenix] It's kind of a long story, \ so hang in there.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] It was the beginning of \ Spring, 4th grade.

[Phoenix] I was on trial. A class trial.

[Maya] A c-class trial!?

********************************************

***Talk about "The class trial"*************

[Phoenix] You remember, Larry? \ Spring, 4th grade?

[Phoenix] A kid in my class got his \ lunch money stolen.

[Maya] Lunch money?

[Phoenix] Our school was really small.

[Phoenix] Every month, kids would bring \ in an envelope with money for \ lunch from home.

[Maya] Huh, I see.

[Phoenix] Anyway, this kid's envelope \ disappeared. With $38.00 still \ inside.

[Butz] Oh... Yeah, now that you \ mention it, I do remember \ that!

[Phoenix] I can see why you'd \ forget though.

[Phoenix] You were out of school \ that day.

[Phoenix] Anyway, the envelope had \ been stolen during PE class.

[Phoenix] I was coming down with a cold, \ so I'd skipped PE that day.

[Phoenix] I was the only one not \ in class.

[Maya] So... they thought you did it?

[Phoenix] Yeah. The kids in class said \ I should be put on trial.

[Maya] Trial...?

[Phoenix] So the next day we held a \ classroom trial, with me \ as the defendant.

[] ---------...

[Phoenix] "I... I didn't do it!"

[] "Guilty!" "He did it!" \ "Guilty!" "It was you!" \ "Thief!"

[] "Give me my money back!" \ "You're such a meanie!" \ "No one play with him!"

[] "Just admit you did it!" \ "You can't hide the truth!" \ "Tell us the truth!"

[] "We're not gonna play with \ you any more!" "Yeah, and \ no borrowing my eraser!"

[] "He shouldn't be allowed in \ the relay race!" "Or on the \ library committee!"

[] "Gimme back that 50 cents I \ loaned you!" "Hey, did you \ rob that bank the other day?"

[Teacher] "Now, Phoenix, you know you \ shouldn't steal people's \ money! It's not right."

[Phoenix] In the end, even the teacher \ thought I'd done it.

[Teacher] "Apologize to the class, \ Phoenix."

[Phoenix] I... I didn't know what \ was happening.

[Phoenix] I was so sad... \ I couldn't stop crying.

[Phoenix] Everyone was staring at me \ like I'd done it...

[Phoenix] I tried to apologize. \ I went over to where \ the boy was sitting...

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] That's when it happened.

[] *OBJECTION!*

[] "He shouldn't have to \ apologize!"

[] "The only thing that belongs \ in a trial is evidence!"

[] "Anything else has no place!"

[] "You should all be ashamed... \ amateurs!"

[Teacher] "M-Miles?"

[Edgeworth] "It wasn't you who stole \ my money, was it?"

[Phoenix] "No..."

[Edgeworth] "Then you shouldn't \ apologize!"

[Edgeworth] "Everyone's been shouting \ you did it, but no one has \ any proof!"

[Edgeworth] "That is why, Your Honor, \ this boy is innocent!"

[Teacher] "B-but Miles, it was your \ money that was stolen!"

[] "Yeah yeah!" \ "He did it! He's the one!"

[] "We don't need proof!" \ "Make him say he's sorry!"

[] "Why don't you all just \ shut up!!!"

[Butz] "This is always how it is, \ everybody ganging up and \ picking on one person."

[Butz] "Just think how he feels!"

[Butz] "He said he didn't do it, \ so he didn't do it!"

[] ...

[Teacher] "Very well."

[Teacher] "I will replace the money \ myself."

[Teacher] "This class trial is over."

[Phoenix] That's how it happened.

[Phoenix] After that, the three of \ us were always friends.

[] ---------...

[Maya] Wow... I had no idea!

[Butz] Yeah... I had no idea, either! \ I mean, I forgot.

[Phoenix] That's when I learned what \ it meant to be alone.

[Phoenix] Totally alone, without a \ friend in the world.

[Maya] You did a good thing, Larry!

[Butz] Um, yeah, well...

[Butz] I was just lucky that I took \ the day off from school.

[Butz] If I'd been there they would \ have thought I'd done it!

[Butz] So, I took it kind of \ personally, see.

[Phoenix] ("When something smells. \ it's usually the Butz.")

********************************************

***Talk about "Edgeworth's goals"***********

[Phoenix] Anyway, Edgeworth and I talked \ after that class trial.

[Phoenix] That's when I heard his \ father was a defense attorney.

[Phoenix] I remember, his eyes would \ shine when he talked about \ his father.

[] ---------...

[Edgeworth] "I'm going to become a defense \ attorney, just like my Dad!"

[Edgeworth] "A famous defense attorney!"

[] ---------...

[Phoenix] Then, a few months later, \ he suddenly transferred \ to another school.

[Maya] The DL-6 Incident...

[Phoenix] Right. I'm not sure, but the \ transfer probably had to do \ with his father's death.

[Maya] That's so sad!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] It was several years later \ when I heard Edgeworth's \ name again.

[Phoenix] There was an article about him \ in the newspaper.

[Phoenix] The headline was something \ like "Dark Suspicions of \ a Demon Attorney."

[Phoenix] Fabricating evidence, \ manipulating testimonies, \ covering up facts...

[Phoenix] The article said he'd do \ anything to get a guilty \ verdict. Anything.

[Butz] But why?

[Butz] What happened!? I mean, \ that's not the Edgey I \ used to know at all!

[Phoenix] That's what I thought too.

[Phoenix] I tried to get in touch \ with him I don't know \ how many times...

[Phoenix] He never replied.

[Maya] I guess he didn't \ want to see his \ old friends...

[Phoenix] I couldn't just drop \ it, though.

[Phoenix] I wanted to meet him, to \ learn why he had become \ who he became.

[Phoenix] That's when I decided.

[Maya] ...!

[Maya] Wait... You don't mean...?

[Maya] That's why!?

[Maya] That's why you became \ a defense attorney!? \ To meet Edgeworth!?

[Phoenix] If I was a defense attorney, \ I knew he'd have to meet me \ whether he wanted to or not.

[Phoenix] In court.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Edgeworth believed in me, \ and I beleive in him.

[Phoenix] He's in pain... \ And no one's on his side.

[Phoenix] I'm the only one who knows \ the real Edgeworth. I'm the \ only one who can help him.

[Butz] Whoa... Nick.

[Butz] S-so, is that why you \ helped me out for free?

[Phoenix] Uh... yes.

[Phoenix] I helped you because \ I believed in you.

[Phoenix] (Except I don't remember \ saying I'd do it for free...)

[Butz] Aww, Nick! Nick!!!

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] We have to save Mr. Edgeworth \ if it's the last thing we do, \ okay?

[Phoenix] Right. \ (It very well may be...)

[Maya] First, there's that rental \ boat shop caretaker.

[Maya] We need to find out \ who or what he is!

[Phoenix] I'd settle for who.

[Phoenix] (I guess I can clean out \ some of this evidence \ I no longer need...)

[Phoenix] (...)

[Phoenix] Okay, let's go!

********************************************

[] MOVE TO: Detention Center

[] December 27 \ Detention Center \ Visitor's Room

[Edgeworth] ...

[Phoenix] You look as grim as always.

[Edgeworth] Hmph.

[Maya] Um, Mr. Edgeworth? \ I heard the story about \ the class trial...

[Edgeworth] Class trial? What do you mean?

[Maya] You... don't remember?

[Edgeworth] No, I don't.

[Maya] Your lunch money was \ stolen, wasn't it? \ In 4th grade...?

[Edgeworth] Lunch money...?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Oh... Oh, right. \ Yes, I seem to remember \ something like that.

[Maya] Nick. \ I think you're the only \ one who really remembers.

[Phoenix] Well, it probably only \ really mattered to me \ anyway.

[Maya] Mr. Edgeworth, didn't \ you know?

[Maya] That trial was the reason \ Nick became a defense \ attorney!

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Ridiculous!

[Phoenix] (Gee... thanks.)

[Edgeworth] That said...

[Edgeworth] It does sound like the \ kind of thing you'd do.

[Edgeworth] You haven't changed a bit, \ have you, Wright? So...simple. \ To a fault, even.

[Phoenix] Well, maybe yeah, but...

[Phoenix] I think you changed \ too much, Edgeworth.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Perhaps.

[] ...

***Present Lake Photo***********************

[Edgeworth] What are you showing me \ this picture for?

[Phoenix] Um, uh, no reason.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] You know, I was impressed \ by your deduction in the \ trial today.

[Edgeworth] Granted, you were at the \ end of your rope, but still.

[Maya] Nick, he noticed.

[Phoenix] Hah hah.

********************************************

***Present DL-6 Case File*******************

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] It was the case that \ changed my life.

[Edgeworth] And tomorrow, on December 28, \ its statute of limitations \ runs out.

[Phoenix] (Tomorrow... Could that be \ a coincidence?)

[Edgeworth] But... even if the case is \ finally closed on paper...

[Edgeworth] It will never be erased from \ my memory. Never...

[Maya] Poor Mr. Edgeworth!

********************************************

***Present DL-6 Incident Photo**************

[Maya] N-Nick! No!

[Maya] Th-that's a photo of his \ father! Don't show him that!

[Phoenix] (You're right...)

[Phoenix] (Now probably isn't a \ good time to dredge \ up those memories...)

[Edgeworth] What is it?

[Phoenix] Uh, um, n-nothing.

[Edgeworth] Huh?

********************************************

***Present other****************************

[Edgeworth] Sorry.

[Edgeworth] I'm not sure I can \ help you with that.

********************************************

***Talk about "Why prosecute?"**************

[Phoenix] Hey, Edgeworth. Why did you \ become a prosecutor, anyway?

[Phoenix] You used to look up to your \ dad... You said you wanted to \ be a defense attorney, right?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] I couldn't let myself deny \ reality like you.

[Pheonix] What do you mean?

[Edgeworth] My father was taken from me, \ and you want me to defend \ criminals?

[Edgeworth] I'm sorry, Wright, but I'm \ not that good of a person!

[Maya] One suspect was apprehended \ in your father's murder, \ right?

[Edgeworth] Yes. The man trapped in the \ elevator with my father.

[Edgeworth] His name... was Yanni Yogi.

[Edgeworth] He had to be the shooter, \ any way you look at it!

[Edgeworth] Yet... he was found innocent. \ That defense attorney got \ him off the hook!

[Phoenix] (That would be Robert \ Hammond...)

[Edgeworth] On that day, 15 years ago...

[Edgeworth] The three of us were trapped \ in that elevator for five \ hours.

[Edgeworth] When we were rescued, we \ all suffered oxygen \ deprivation.

[Edgeworth] I had lost all memory of \ the murder.

[Phoenix] Lost your memory?

[Edgeworth] Even now, I can't recall \ what happened in that \ elevator.

[Edgeworth] That was the crux of Yogi's \ attorney's argument in court.

[Edgeworth] He claimed Yanni Yogi had \ been "not of sound mind" due \ to the oxygen deprivation.

[Edgeworth] Yogi was released due to a \ lack of evidence... innocent.

[Edgeworth] That's when I changed my mind.

[Edgeworth] I started to hate defense \ attorneys.

********************************************

***Talk about "Prosecutor von Karma"********

[Phoenix] What's your relationship \ with von Karma?

[Edgeworth] He's my teacher, and a man \ who deserves respect.

[Edgeworth] I learned everything I know \ of courtroom techniques \ from him.

[Maya] So, he's like my sister \ was to you, Nick.

[Edgeworth] He is a perfectionist \ in all things.

[Edgeworth] In court... \ In his personal life...

[Edgeworth] He is obsessed with doing \ everything perfectly.

[Maya] Perfectly, huh?

[Edgeworth] In all the cases he has \ taken on, none were left \ unsolved.

[Edgeworth] And not one suspect was \ declared innocent. Ever.

[Maya] But... but that's...

[Edgeworth] I know.

[Edgeworth] It's possible some of the \ suspects were indeed innocent.

[Edgeworth] However, it is impossible \ for us to accurately determine \ that in every case.

[Edgeworth] All von Karma does is his \ job, to find the suspect \ guilty, perfectly.

[Edgeworth] In any case...

[Edgeworth] It's nigh well impossible \ to find a weakness in him.

[Edgeworth] Should a weakness appear, \ he would do everything in his \ power to make it go away.

[Phoenix] Um, Edgeworth?

[Phoenix] If what you're saying is \ true, you're headed for \ a guilty sentence tomorrow!

[Maya] H-he's right! \ Now's no time to praise \ the enemy, Mr. Edgeworth!

[Edgeworth] Mmph...

[Edgeworth] It's a strange situation \ in which I find myself, \ I'll admit.

[Phoenix] (No kidding.)

[Gumshoe] Look, I'll make you a promise.

[Gumshoe] The woods are off-limits to \ camping, and apparently \ the park ranger found out.

[Maya] But who could have written \ that letter?

[Maya] And... what does it mean, \ to "get revenge on Miles \ Edgeworth"...?

[Phoenix] Look, I don't know, okay?

[Phoenix] But one thing's for \ certain.

[Phoenix] This letter is an \ amazing clue!

[] Added Letter from the Safe \ to the Court Record.

***Examine safe again***********************

[Phoenix] There's nothing left \ in the safe.

[Maya] I wonder why the caretaker \ didn't take the letter \ with him?

[Phoenix] He left in a hurry, right? \ I don't think he even came \ back here after the trial.

[Maya] Stop showing me stuff \ and let's get cracking!

[Maya] We only have today to \ get to the bottom of this!

********************************************

[Phoenix] What do you think we should \ do now, Maya?

[Maya] You would know best, Nick!

[Maya] Just do what you do! \ That should work.

********************************************

***Talk about "Any ideas"*******************

[Phoenix] Well? \ Had any good ideas?

[Maya] This is all tied to the \ DL-6 Incident...

[Maya] We'd better find out as much \ as we can about that murder \ before tomorrow!

[Phoenix] (Something that happened back \ then has a hold on Edgeworth \ and it won't let go.)

***Present Letter from the Safe*************

[Phoenix] Edgeworth... \ See this letter?

[Edgeworth] Hmm?

[Phoenix] This came out of the safe \ in the shack where that boat \ rental caretaker lives.

[Edgeworth] I see...

[Edgeworth] ...!

[Edgeworth] Revenge... on me?

[Maya] Who is that old guy, anyway!?

[Edgeworth] I... I don't know.

[Phoenix] Could he be an innocent \ defendant you got declared \ guilty or something?

[Edgeworth] Nice, Wright. \ But I don't remember that \ old man. Not at all.

[Maya] So, he was following this \ letter, then?

[Edgeworth] Which means there was someone \ else behind it!

[] "Now is your time to get \ revenge on the two men \ who ruined your life!"

[Edgeworth] Two men... meaning myself \ and Robert Hammond?

[Maya] It also says: "This is your \ last chance!"

[Phoenix] Last chance...? \ Wait, maybe...

[Phoenix] Maybe he's talking about the \ statute of limitations on \ the DL-6 Incident!

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Wait...

[Edgeworth] Wait, that old man...!

[Maya] Wh-what is it!? \ Do you know who he is!?

[Edgeworth] Yogi... \ Could he be Yogi!?

[Maya] Yogi?

[Edgeworth] The suspect in the DL-6 \ Incident. The one who \ was found innocent.

********************************************

***Talk about "Yanni Yogi"******************

[Edgeworth] Yanni Yogi was a court \ bailiff at the time.

[Edgeworth] We just happened to be in \ that elevator together 15 \ years ago.

[Edgeworth] The quake was incredibly \ strong...

[Edgeworth] Before I knew it, everything \ was dark.

[Edgeworth] We were there for so long, \ it felt like forever.

[Edgeworth] The air thinned... and the \ darkness closed in on us \ in that little box.

[Edgeworth] We became... unsettled.

[] ---------...

[] "H-help! I can't breathe!"

[] "Quiet! I said quiet! \ You're not making this \ any easier!"

[] "I want to get out! \ Help! Get us out!"

[] "Don't shout! You'll just \ use up more oxygen!"

[] "...!"

[] ---------...

[Edgeworth] That's all I remember...

[Edgeworth] When I came to, I was in \ a hospital bed, staring \ up at the ceiling.

[Edgeworth] In court, Yanni Yogi's \ mental condition was \ called into question.

[Edgeworth] They claimed the oxygen \ deprivation and stress \ had caused temporary insanity.

[Edgeworth] In the end, the claim passed \ the court, and Yogi was \ found innocent.

[Maya] Huh... \ But, isn't that strange?

[Maya] This letter tells him to \ "get revenge on Edgeworth"...

[Maya] Why would he want to take \ revenge on you?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Wright.

[Phoenix] Yeah?

[Edgeworth] There's something that's been \ troubling me these last few \ days.

[Edgeworth] I... didn't know whether or \ not I should tell you.

[Phoenix] You mean the nightmare?

[] ---------...

[Edgeworth] It's... a nightmare I've had.

[Edgeworth] A memory of a crime... \ that I committed.

[Phoenix] A crime you committed?

[Edgeworth] ...A memory... of a murder.

[] ---------...

[Edgeworth] I think...

[Edgeworth] I think the time has \ come to tell all.

********************************************

***Talk about "The nightmare"***************

[Edgeworth] For the last 15 years, I've \ had the same dream almost \ every night.

[Edgeworth] I wake up in a fearful \ sweat, every time.

[Maya] What kind of dream?

[Edgeworth] It's a dream about my father's \ killing... in the dark.

[] ---------...

[] "H-help! I can't breathe!"

[] "Quiet! I said quiet! \ You're not making this \ any easier!"

[] "I want to get out! \ Help! Get us out!"

[] "Don't shout! You'll just \ use up more oxygen!"

[] "I... I can't breath! \ You... you're using up \ my air!"

[] "Wh-what!?"

[] "Stop breathing my air! \ I'll... I'll stop you!"

[] "Aaaah! Wh-what!? \ What are you...!?"

[] "Stop breathing my aaaaair!"

[] (No! Father!)

[] (He's attacking Father!)

[Edgeworth] Then I see the pistol \ lying by my feet.

[Edgeworth] I don't know if it was \ evidence from that day \ in court, or the bailiff's...

[Edgeworth] In a daze, I pick up \ the pistol...

[Edgeworth] (Get away...!)

[Edgeworth] (Get away from my father!)

[] *BANG*

[] Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaa \ aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

[] ---------...

[Edgeworth] And with that scream... \ I wake.

[Edgeworth] It's a bone-chilling scream.

[Edgeworth] A scream that has rung in \ my ears for the past 15 years.

[Maya] ...

[Maya] B-but...

[Maya] That's just a dream, right? \ Right?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] That thought is the only thig \ that has kept me sane for the \ last 15 years.

[Edgeworth] But what if I'm wrong?

[Edgeworth] What if it's real?

[Edgeworth] They say that sometimes people \ shut out memories in self- \ defense.

[Edgeworth] Maybe it was I who killed \ my father!

[Maya] What!?

[Edgeworth] If you think about it that \ way, this letter makes sense.

[Edgeworth] "Get your revenge on \ Miles Edgeworth."

[Edgeworth] Think about it. Yogi was \ really innocent.

[Edgeworth] That's why he wanted revenge \ against me!

[Phoenix] Wait, Edgeworth! \ You... you mean...!

[Edgeworth] It was me.

[Edgeworth] I was the true criminal \ of DL-6. I shot my father!

[Phoenix] This is bad...

[Maya] What are we going to do, \ Nick? What can we do!?

[Phoenix] I don't know...

[Phoenix] I don't think there is \ anything we can do. \ Like it or not.

[Phoenix] If there's someone else \ who knows a lot about \ the DL-6 Incident, maybe...

[Maya] ...!

[Maya] There is, Nick!

[Maya] There is someone else who \ knows about DL-6!

[] December 27 \ Grossberg Law Offices

[Phoenix] M-Mr. Grossberg!

[Grossberg] Ah, hello there. \ What's wrong? \ You look troubled.

[Maya] No kidding! \ I can't believe you're not!

[Grossberg] M-my my my...

[Grossberg] Just calm down and tell \ me what's happened, hmm?

[Maya] It's M-Mr. Edgeworth! \ He... He... *sob*

[] ---------...

[Grossberg] I see...

[Grossberg] So, Edgeworth dreamt \ he shot his own father?

[Maya] It's o-only a dream! \ Only a dream!

[Grossberg] ...

[Grossberg] I wonder...

[Maya] W-what...?

[Grossberg] If that's the case, then \ why do you two look so \ troubled, hmm?

[Maya] W-well...

[Grossberg] Also, consider this.

[Grossberg] Yogi quite certainly holds \ a deep grudge against Miles \ Edgeworth.

[Grossberg] So deep, he'd want to frame \ him for murder.

[Grossberg] This leads me to surmise...

[Grossberg] That Mr. Edgeworth's dream \ was NOT a dream. It was real.

[Grossberg] As you imagined.

[Grossberg] Miles Edgeworth threw the \ pistol to save his father...

[Grossberg] the pistol fired... \ and the deed was done.

[Grossberg] ...

[Maya] N... No!

[Maya] I don't believe it!

[Grossberg] Yogi was suspected of murder, \ and his career as a bailiff \ was irrevocably wrecked.

[Grossberg] Thus, he sought revenge \ on Miles Edgeworth.

[Grossberg] This was his last chance, of \ course, with the statute of \ limitations so close.

[] ...

***Present Lake Photo***********************

[Grossberg] In any case, it's good that \ the one shooting isn't Miles.

[Phoenix] You bet it's good!

[Phoenix] (I can't believe the fiendish \ planning that went into this \ murder...)

[Phoenix] (And we almost fell right \ into his trap!)

[Maya] What a creep!

********************************************

***Present Misty Fey's Photo****************

[Grossberg] Ah, she was a beautiful \ woman...

[Grossberg] This incident took place \ 15 years ago tomorrow.

[Grossberg] So tomorrow will see the \ completion of not one, \ but two trials.

[Grossberg] All thanks to the statute of \ limitations.

[Grossberg] However...

[Grossberg] Gregory Edgeworth...?

********************************************

***Present Letter from the Safe*************

[Grossberg] Oh ho! \ So this is the letter?

[Grossberg] It does seem that Yogi was \ following this letter...

[Grossberg] when he killed Hammond.

[Maya] But, why kill Robert Hammond?

[Grossberg] Hammond was a skilled \ defense attorney.

[Grossberg] But... he defended clients \ not for their sake, but \ for his own.

[Phoenix] Huh? His own sake?

[Grossberg] He never trusted his \ clients, that one.

[Grossberg] The only thing he trusted \ was his own ability.

[Maya] But, he got his client \ found innocent. So why \ should it matter?

[Grossberg] Actually, my dear, it's \ quite different.

[Grossberg] He won that innocent verdict \ for no one but himself.

[Grossberg] Yogi was a free man, but \ socially, he was ruined.

[Phoenix] (Huh...?)

[Grossberg] You'll understand soon \ enough.

[Grossberg] ...

[Grossberg] Wait!

[Phoenix] What is it?

[Grossberg] This letter...

[Grossberg] I've seen this handwriting \ somewhere before... a long \ time ago!

[Grossberg] Whose handwriting was \ this...?

[Grossberg] Do you have any idea \ who wrote this?

***Miles Edgeworth**************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * Miles Edgeworth?

[] * -Grossberg \ * Wh-wh-whaaat!?

[] * -Grossberg \ * Why in heavens would he \ * write something like this!?

[] * -Grossberg \ * Why, this letter is an \ * attempt to destroy Miles!

[] * -Grossberg \ * Think before you speak, \ * greenhorn!

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Uh oh. He's angry.)

[] * -Grossberg \ * Think again!

[] * RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

***Yanni Yogi*******************************

[] * -Phoenix \ * Maybe it was Yanni Yogi?

[] * -Grossberg \ * Yanni Yogi!?

[] * -Grossberg \ * You claim he wrote himself \ * this letter... then followed \ * his own instructions?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Uh... Yeah, I guess that \ * would be what happened.

[] * -Grossberg \ * Harumph! Perhaps you think \ * Mr. Yogi has a split- \ * personality, hmm?

[] * -Phoenix \ * I think that's definitely \ * a possibility, yes...

[] * -Grossberg \ * Hmm...

[] * -Grossberg \ * No, I think not. I do not \ * know this Yogi, in any case.

[] * -Grossberg \ * There's no way I would \ * recognize his handwriting.

[] * -Phoenix \ * Oh, right...

[] * -Grossberg \ * Yes, Wright. \ * I'll ask you again.

[] * RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

***Manfred von Karma************************

[] * CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] Hmm... could it be \ Manfred von Karma?

[Grossberg] von Karma? Why would he have \ something to do with this?

[Phoenix] Um, well, I'm not sure...

[Grossberg] ...

[Grossberg] Hmm? \ von Karma... von Karma...

[Grossberg] W-wait! You're right, my boy!

[Grossberg] This is von Karma's handwriting, \ I'm sure of it!

[Grossberg] I used to see it all the \ time on court reports...

[Maya] Whaaaaaat!? \ But... but that means...!

[Maya] Th-the one who told \ Mr. Yogi to kill was...

[Grossberg] Correct. \ Manfred von Karma, himself!

[Phoenix] What does this mean, then?

[Phoenix] Why would von Karma want \ to frame Edgeworth...?

********************************************

***Present Letter from the Safe again*******

[Grossberg] No doubt about it, this \ is von Karma's handwriting.

[Grossberg] Yogi was following von Karma's \ instructions when he killed \ Hammond.

[Maya] But, why kill Robert Hammond?

[Grossberg] Hammond was a skilled \ defense attorney.

[Grossberg] But... he defended clients \ not for their sake, but \ for his own.

[Phoenix] Huh? His own sake?

[Grossberg] He never trusted his \ clients, that one.

[Grossberg] The only thing he trusted \ was his own ability.

[Maya] But, he got his client \ found innocent. So why \ should it matter?

[Grossberg] Actually, my dear, it's \ quite different.

[Grossberg] He won that innocent verdict \ for no one but himself.

[Grossberg] Yogi was a free man, but \ socially, he was ruined.

[Phoenix] (Huh...?)

[Grossberg] You'll understand soon \ enough.

[Grossberg] ...

[Grossberg] Now, there's only one \ question left.

[Grossberg] Why did von Karma write \ this?

[Grossberg] And why now?

********************************************

***Talk about "Gregory Edgeworth"***********

[Phoenix] What do you know about \ Edgeworth's father?

[Grossberg] ...

[Grossberg] He was a defense attorney \ without peer.

[Grossberg] It sounds trite, but \ it's true.

[Grossberg] Well, he may have had one peer \ now that I think about it.

[Grossberg] Your mentor, Mia Fey.

[Maya] My sister...?

[Grossberg] Gregory Edgeworth was very \ disapproving of Mr. von \ Karma's techniques.

[Phoenix] (That's no surprise...)

[Grossberg] von Karma is an extreme man. \ Forged testimonies and \ evidence are nothing to him.

[Grossberg] The result: he has a perfect \ win record in court.

[Grossberg] To beat him, Gregory \ Edgeworth tried to call \ attention to his methods.

[Maya] And...?

[Grossberg] He lost.

[Grossberg] And died in despair, \ as it were.

[Maya] I see...

********************************************

***Talk about "The spirit medium"***********

[Grossberg] When Gregory Edgeworth was \ killed, the police called \ on a spirit medium.

[Grossberg] That was your mother, \ Misty Fey.

[] ---------...

[] "I am Gregory Edgeworth... \ I have been killed..."

[] "The one who shot me... \ was the bailiff... \ Yanni Yogi."

[] ---------...

[Grossberg] Yet Yogi was found innocent.

[Maya] That's when my mother left us.

[Maya] Everyone called her a fraud.

[Grossberg] That's right. Everyone thought \ she was, you see.

[Grossberg] Yet... now that I think about \ it.

[Grossberg] It seems the one who lied \ was Gregory Edgeworth's \ ghost...

[Grossberg] Gregory Edgeworth must have \ known who shot him.

[Phoenix] I don't believe it...

[Phoenix] So you're saying he falsified \ his "testimony"?

[Phoenix] That Edgeworth's dad lied to \ protect his son...?

[Grossberg] It's only a possibility, \ mind you.

[Grossberg] But... a possibility \ nonetheless.

********************************************

***Talk about "Prosecutor von Karma"********

[Grossberg] If it truly was von Karma \ who wrote this letter, then \ he would know the truth.

[Grossberg] He would know that Miles \ Edgeworth had accidentally \ killed his own father.

[Phoenix] ...!

[Grossberg] He'll say as much tomorrow \ in court, I should think.

[Grossberg] He'll press the point until \ the court finds Miles \ Edgeworth "guilty."

[Phoenix] Oh no!

[Maya] B-but how could von Karma \ know about Mr. Edgeworth's \ past like that?

[Maya] Even Mr. Edgeworth thought \ it was just a nightmare!

[Grossberg] Hmm... \ That, I do not know.

[Grossberg] Yet I do know that von Karma \ is both persistent... \ and a perfectionist.

[Grossberg] He may be seeking to satisfy \ a grudge against Gregory \ Edgeworth by hurting his son.

[Phoenix] What do you mean?

[Grossberg] It was fifteen years ago...

[Grossberg] von Karma met Gregory \ Edgeworth in court, and \ von Karma did win...

[Grossberg] But he didn't make it \ through the trial unscarred.

********************************************

***Talk about "Gregory vs. Manfred"*********

[Phoenix] What happened in the trial \ between Edgeworth's dad \ and von Karma?

[Grossberg] von Karma got the "guilty" \ verdict he wanted. He won \ the trial.

[Grossberg] But Gregory Edgeworth accused \ von Karma of faulty evidence.

[Grossberg] And though he lost the trial, \ Mr. Edgeworth's accusation \ stood.

[Maya] Faulty evidence?

[Grossberg] It was the only penalty \ von Karma has ever received in \ his career as a prosecutor.

[Grossberg] Gregory Edgeworth dealt a blow \ to his perfect trial record.

[Maya] Wow.

[Grossberg] It must have been quite \ a shock for von Karma.

[Grossberg] He took a vacation for \ several months after that, \ you see.

[Phoenix] A vacation...?

[Grossberg] Yes, an unusual event \ for the man.

[Grossberg] That was the first, and the \ last vacation he's taken in \ his many years of prosecuting.

[Maya] Really!? \ He doesn't take vacations!?

[Maya] Like... go to the sea, \ or, uh, to the mountains?

[Maya] Don't tell me he's never been \ to Europe!?

[Phoenix] You have strange ideas \ about vacations, Maya.

[Grossberg] In any case...

[Grossberg] That was the only time he \ took a vacation from work.

[Grossberg] I believe the penalty upset \ him quite a lot.

[Phoenix] (Odd... If he wanted to \ keep a perfect record \ so badly...)

[Phoenix] (why would he take such \ a long vacation?)

********************************************

[] AFTER TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING

[Maya] What do we do, Nick?

[Maya] von Karma is going to bring \ up DL-6, you can bet on it!

[Maya] What if Mr. Edgeworth pleads \ guilty to DL-6!?

[Phoenix] I won't let him!

[Grossberg] Erm, yes, Mr. Wright...

[Grossberg] I hate to say this...

[Grossberg] But even accidental murder \ is murder, you know.

[Phoenix] I know that!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] I... I just believe in \ Edgeworth's innocence!

[Phoenix] I can't believe he'd \ kill someone!

[Maya] B-but, Nick!

[Maya] Mr. Edgeworth admits \ it himself!

[Maya] His father must have lied \ to protect him, from beyond \ the grave...

[Phoenix] I don't care!

[Phoenix] I know he's not guilty!

[Grossberg] ...

[Grossberg] Mr. Wright...

[Grossberg] If you say so, I suppose \ I could go check again.

[Grossberg] The police files might \ hold something of interest.

[Phoenix] Mr. Grossberg... thank you!

[Grossberg] I can't promise anything. \ In fact, I think the chances \ of finding something are slim.

[Phoenix] I understand.

[Phoenix] (The police materials... hmm.)

[Karma] Ahem. I beg your pardon, you \ see, I rarely remember defense \ attorneys.

[Karma] They are like bugs to \ me. Needless things, \ to be crushed.

[Phoenix] (I can see how this guy \ was Edgeworth's mentor.)

********************************************

***Examine open drawer again****************

[Phoenix] This large drawer is \ half-open.

[Phoenix] The label on the drawer reads: \ "Unsolved Cases: Evidence."

[Maya] Uh, umm... Mr. Edgeworth \ was your student, right?

[Karma] ...

[Karma] A romanticist who could \ never shed that veneer \ of amateurism.

[Karma] Just like his father. \ Always second rate.

[Phoenix] Mr. von Karma...

[Phoenix] You had an axe to grind with \ Mr. Gregory Edgeworth, didn't \ you?

[Karma] Me? A grudge against a mere \ defense attorney? Why?

[Phoenix] Because he dealt a blow to \ your otherwise perfect trial \ record?

[Karma] Hmph.

[Phoenix] So you did... but what I \ don't get is...

[Phoenix] Why did you take his son \ under your wing afterwards?

[Phoenix] The son of your most \ bitter rival?

[Karma] ...

[Karma] That, my dear attorney, \ is none of your business.

********************************************

***Talk about "Tomorrow's trial"************

[Karma] Tomorrow will be the last \ day of this trial.

[Karma] It's been a while since I've \ had a defense attorney last \ this long.

[Karma] Still, you will lose \ in the end.

[Karma] Miles Edgeworth will admit \ his own guilt.

[Phoenix] His guilt of 15 years ago, \ you mean?

[Karma] ...

[Karma] You're quite the researcher.

[Karma] If you've done your homework \ so well, then certainly, \ you must understand.

[Karma] You know what Miles Edgeworth \ will tell the court tomorrow.

[Phoenix] (We were right...)

[Phoenix] (So von Karma is going to \ bring up DL-6 in court \ tomorrow.)

********************************************

***Present Letter from the Safe*************

[Phoenix] Mr. von Karma, \ have a look at this.

[Karma] ...

[Phoenix] This was you, wasn't it?

[Phoenix] You instructed Yanni Yogi \ to commit murder.

[Karma] ...

[Karma] Yanni Yogi...

[Karma] How many years has it been \ since I've heard him called \ by that name.

[Karma] He's a fool.

[Karma] I told him to burn it after \ he read it.

[Maya] ...!

[Maya] S-so you admit it!

[Maya] You... you wrote Mr. Yogi \ this letter!

[Karma] Yes, my dear defense \ attorney.

[Karma] Thank you for taking the \ trouble to bring it to me.

[Karma] You've saved me from a lot \ of needless hassle.

[Phoenix] Wh-what!?

[Maya] N-Nick! \ What is that thing!?

[Phoenix] A stun gun. \ For self defense... usually.

[Karma] Indeed.

[Karma] 600,000 volts will course \ through your body like a dog \ touching an electric fence.

[Phoenix] Six hundred thous...!?

[Karma] Oh, don't worry. \ People don't die from it, \ usually.

[Karma] Now, give me the letter.

[Maya] ...

[Maya] I... I couldn't stop him.

[Maya] I jumped as fast as I could, \ but one shot from that thing \ knocked me out cold.

[Maya] I'm useless.

[Maya] I'm no good as a lawyer, or \ a medium! I can't even call \ my sister.

[Maya] Not even now, when we need \ her the most.

[Maya] I wish I hadn't woken up \ at all.

[Phoenix] Maya!

[Phoenix] (I'd better do something about \ her self-confidence, first.)

[Phoenix] ...?

[Phoenix] (Maya... \ She's holding something!)

[Phoenix] (What is that? A bullet?)

[Phoenix] "DL-6 Incident, Evidence No. 7 \ Taken from the heart of \ Gregory Edgeworth."

[Phoenix] I remember...

[Phoenix] von Karma was holding this \ when Maya jumped him.

[] Put DL-6 Bullet in pocket.

[Phoenix] (I'll prove it to you, \ Maya.)

[Phoenix] (You're most definitely \ not useless!)

[Phoenix] (I'll prove it to you \ in court tomorrow!)

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green December 28, 9:51 AM \ District Court \ Defendant Lobby No. 2

[Phoenix] (This is it... judgment day.)

[Phoenix] (Today, things are going to \ get settled at last... \ a lot of things.)

[Phoenix] Waaaaaaaargh!

[Phoenix] Wh-what's the big idea!?

[Maya] S-s-sorry, Nick!

[Maya] I only touched your shoulder!

[Maya] I guess the "shock" hasn't \ worn off from my run-in with \ the stun gun yesterday.

[Maya] Anyhow, today's the last day \ of the trial! Good luck, Nick!

[Phoenix] Yeah... thanks, Maya.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Phoenix] (Edgeworth is looking glum \ as always.)

[Phoenix] (I hope von Karma doesn't \ push him too hard.)

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Whooooooooaa!

[Edgeworth] Wh-wh-what are you doing!?

[Maya] Sorry! I'm sorry!

[Maya] I just thought I'd ch-cheer \ you up with a pat on the \ back...

[Phoenix] Maya...

[Phoenix] Maybe you should go outside \ and discharge?

[Maya] Right. Good idea.

[Phoenix] (Try not to electrocute \ anyone on your way out...)

[] Woooooooooyaaah, pal!

[Gumshoe] What's gotten into that girl?

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe!

[Gumshoe] Morning! \ Mr. Edgeworth?

[Edgeworth] Uh... good morning.

[Phoenix] How did it go, Detective?

[Gumshoe] Have no fear! As promised, \ I've captured our runaway \ caretaker!

[Gumshoe] I just brought him in. \ Took all night, pal.

[Phoenix] Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. \ You must be tired.

[Gumshoe] Actually, after that shock \ I got on the way in, I feel \ pretty good.

[Phoenix] (Yogi says he's forgotten \ his own name...)

[Phoenix] (But that has to be a lie!)

[Phoenix] (Why would he want revenge on \ Edgeworth if he couldn't \ remember his past!?)

[Phoenix] (He does remember... and \ I'm going to prove it!)

[] ...

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green December 28, 10:00 AM \ District Court \ Courtroom No. 3

[Judge] Court is now in session for \ the trial of Miles Edgeworth.

[Phoenix] The defense is ready, \ Your Honor.

[Karma] ...

[Karma] The prosecution... \ is ready.

[Judge] ...

[Judge] U-uh... right, very well.

[Judge] We have reached the final \ day of our proceedings in \ this trial.

[Judge] I ask that the prosecution \ submit decisive evidence.

[Karma] Understood.

[Judge] ...

[Phoenix] (C'mon! Don't be awed into \ silence by every little \ thing he says!)

[Judge] Very well, Mr. von Karma, \ your opening statement.

[Karma] Right.

[Karma] Thanks to Detective Gumshoe's \ efforts, the boat rental shop \ caretaker has been arrested.

[Karma] In yesterday's trial, the \ defense asserted that the \ caretaker was the murderer.

[Karma] However, the caretaker has \ yet to confirm this.

[Karma] I would like to ask the \ defense to cross-examine \ him as much as necessary.

[Judge] Very well!

[Judge] Please bring the witness \ into the courtroom.

[] ...

[Karma] Ladies and gentlemen of \ the court...

[Karma] I believe you all remember \ our witness.

[Karma] He lives in the boat rental \ shop on the lake, from where \ he witnessed the incident.

[Karma] In addition, he has currently \ lost memory of his name and \ identity.

[Judge] Witness!

[Judge] Why did you run away \ yesterday?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] The witness was not running \ away, as he will now testify.

[Judge] I-I see.

[Judge] Very well, please begin \ your testimony.

[Uncle] Zzzz... mmph?

[] ...

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- Why I Left Court --

[Uncle] (1) \ Er, I'm really sorry about \ just leaving yesterday like \ I did.

[Uncle] (2) \ But, I wasn't running away \ or nothing.

[Uncle] (3) \ I, uh, went to buy some food \ for Polly, see...

[Uncle] (4) \ I figured I got nothing to \ do with this incident anyhow.

[Uncle] (5) \ Er... I mean, I'd need one of \ those "motive" things, right? \ And I don't got one.

[Uncle] So, my testimony yesterday \ stands as is.

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm... Very well.

[Judge] Let's begin the cross- \ examination, shall we?

[Phoenix] (He has to know his name!)

[Phoenix] (Yanni Yogi! You're Yanni Yogi \ and I'm going to prove it!)

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Why I Left Court --

[Uncle] (1) \ Er, I'm really sorry about \ just leaving yesterday like \ I did.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] I'd call what you did "running \ away," and not "just leaving."

[Phoenix] You heard Larry's testimony, \ and realized you were in \ danger!

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Now, Mr. Wright, there's no \ need to rush to conclusions.

[Karma] As I said, the witness \ was not "running away."

[Karma] Listen to the testimony.

[Phoenix] (He sure seems relaxed!)

[Phoenix] (In fact, they both do-- \ von Karma and Yanni Yogi!)

[Uncle] (2) \ But, I wasn't running away \ or nothing.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Then why did you leave!?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] He's just about to say why!

[Karma] Is it so hard for you to \ just quietly listen when \ someone is talking!?

[Phoenix] (If I sat quietly, Edgeworth \ would be guilty in three \ minutes!)

[Uncle] (3) \ I, uh, went to buy some food \ for Polly, see...

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Food...?

[Uncle] Well, Polly is a bit of a \ gourmand, you see.

[Uncle] She only eats these high- \ quality bird pellets from \ France.

[Uncle] They only have them in the \ big pet shop downtown.

[Phoenix] But you weren't arrested \ until this morning!

[Phoenix] Why didn't you go back \ to the caretaker's shack?

[Uncle] Er... well...

[Uncle] I kind of got lost, you see.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] The witness has trouble \ remembering things sometimes.

[Karma] When the police apprehended \ him, he was on his way back \ to the shack!

[Phoenix] (Yeah, right! Nice try \ von Karma! No one's \ going to believe that!)

[Judge] Hmm... I see! \ So he was lost!

[Phoenix] (Please! Your Honor, come \ to your senses!)

[Uncle] (4) \ I figured I got nothing to \ do with this incident anyhow.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] You've lost much of your \ memory, is that correct?

[Uncle] Er... ayup, seems like it.

[Phoenix] Then how could you know that \ you didn't have anything to \ do with this incident!

[Uncle] Uh...

[Phoenix] Or...

[Phoenix] Or maybe you're lying about \ not having your memory, hmm?

[Phoenix] You know exactly who \ you are!

[Karma] The witness has testified \ quite clearly that he has \ no memory of who he is.

[Karma] If you claim he's lying, \ then show the court proof!

[Phoenix] (Grr...)

[Phoenix] (How am I supposed to prove \ what's going on in that \ old codger's head?)

[Phoenix] (That's impossible!)

[Karma] Hmph! \ I'm glad you've come to \ your senses, Mr. Wright.

[Karma] Very well, witness. \ Please continue.

[Uncle] (5) \ Er... I mean, I'd need one of \ those "motive" things, right? \ And I don't got one.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] How can you say you had \ no motive? I say you do!

[Phoenix] You had a grudge against \ Edgeworth and the victim, \ Robert Hammond!

[Phoenix] That's why you took revenge \ on them! Right?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Please don't make me \ repeat myself, Mr. Wright!

[Karma] This witness has no memory \ of anything beyond several \ years ago!

[Karma] He can't hold a grudge! \ It's impossible!

[Phoenix] (I have to prove he's lying \ about his memory...)

[Phoenix] (Otherwise, it's going to \ be this same thing over and \ over until the trial ends!)

[Phoenix] (First thigns first, I have \ to prove this man is who \ he is!)

[Phoenix] (Do that and the motive \ will prove itself!)

[] ...

[] AFTER PRESSING FOR A WHILE

[Judge] Might I say something, \ Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Yes... \ Yes, Your Honor?

[Judge] You've been saying the \ same thing now over and \ over.

[Judge] You've been calling the \ witness's memory of the past \ or lack thereof into question.

[Judge] But, does this really have \ anything to do with the \ current case?

[Phoenix] Of course, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] The witness has said he has \ "nothing to do with this \ case" and "no motive"...

[Phoenix] Both of these statements \ are lies!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] Mr. Wright! \ There is a serious problem \ with your claim!

[Judge] Or... are you saying...

[Judge] Are you saying you know \ who this witness is!?

[Phoenix] Of course, Your Honor!

[Karma] Ho hoh! Now, this is \ interesting.

[Karma] I would like to know \ myself! So, who is he?

[Phoenix] (Don't play dumb von Karma!)

[Judge] Mr. Wright, please tell \ us this witness's name.

***Gregory Edgeworth************************

[Phoenix] His name... \ is "Gregory Edgeworth"!

[Phoenix] ...

[Judge] Er... Mr. Wright?

[Judge] All of us here remember what \ Gregory Edgeworth looked like.

[Judge] And he looked nothing like \ this, believe me.

[Phoenix] (Wow... that's pretty \ harsh, Your Honor...)

[Judge] I'm going to have to \ penalize you for your \ wild claim!

[Judge] Now... let me ask you again.

[] RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

***Yanni Yogi*******************************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Robert Hammond***************************

[Phoenix] His name... \ is "Robert Hammond"!

[Judge] ...

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Judge] Robert Hammond is the name \ of the victim in this case.

[Phoenix] Uh...

[Judge] Generally, the victim in a \ murder case is no longer \ living.

[Phoenix] That's true...

[Judge] Please, try again.

[] RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

[Phoenix] His name is Yanni Yogi, \ a former court bailiff!

[Judge] ...

[Judge] Yogi...? \ That name seems familiar.

[Judge] ...

[Judge] Oh!

[Judge] Yanni Yogi! \ From the DL-6 Incident!

[Phoenix] (I thought the judge would \ have heard of it... it was \ such a famous case.)

[Judge] But, what does this mean?

[Phoenix] Your Honor! If this man is \ Mr. Yogi, then he has a \ clear motive!

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk...

[Karma] Jumping to conclusions again, \ Mr. Wright!

[Karma] This man, this witness, is \ Yanni Yogi? Fascinating!

[Karma] However...

[Karma] How do you propose to \ prove this to the court?

[Phoenix] ...

[Karma] This is a court of law, \ as you may recall. You \ need proof!

[Karma] And, allow me to repeat, \ once more, that the witness \ has lost his memory!

[Phoenix] (This is it...)

[Phoenix] (I have to do this now!)

[Phoenix] (If I can't prove he's \ Yogi right here, right \ now...)

[Phoenix] (Then I've got nowhere \ else to go!)

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] How are you going to prove \ it!? How can you prove that \ he's Yanni Yogi?

[Phoenix] It's okay. It's actually \ quite simple.

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] Please take this man's \ fingerprints!

[Phoenix] Then, we'll compare them to \ the fingerprints on file \ for Yanni Yogi 15 years ago...

[Judge] I see... that makes sense.

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk!

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Karma] I'm so very, very sorry, \ Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] Wh-why?

[Karma] The witness... has no \ fingerprints!

[Phoenix] What? \ What!? No fingerprints!?

[Uncle] Er... you see, before I worked \ as a caretaker, I worked at \ a chemical plant.

[Uncle] I burned my fingers working \ with the stuff. Ayup.

[Phoenix] Wh-what!?

[Phoenix] (Yogi, you sneak!)

[Phoenix] (You burned your fingerprints \ off to hide your past!)

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Well, if the witness has \ no fingerprints...

[Judge] I guess we will not be \ able to prove his identity.

[Phoenix] (No...!)

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk... \ Well, what will you \ do, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Uh...

[Karma] Hmm?

[Karma] It seems that the case \ has been decided, no?

[Phoenix] (No!!!)

[Phoenix] (I know what happened! \ I know everything!)

[Phoenix] (I... I just can't prove it!)

[Phoenix] (But no... I can't let it end \ like this. I can't lose!)

[Phoenix] (There has to be another way!)

[Karma] There is no one who can \ testify as to who this \ witness is! No one!

[Maya] Nick! \ What are we going to do!?

[Phoenix] I didn't even consider that \ he might have erased his \ fingerprints...

[Phoenix] (What do I do!?)

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk... \ Well, Mr. Wright?

[Karma] Perhaps you'd like to cross- \ examine the parrot for a \ little comic relief, hmm?

[Phoenix] (Yeah, yeah, very funny. \ You're a sore winner, \ von Karma.)

[Phoenix] (...)

[Phoenix] (Wait a second...)

[Phoenix] ("Cross-examine the parrot"?)

[Maya] Wh-what is it, Nick?

[Maya] No... you're not going to...!?

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] The defense would like to \ take Mr. von Karma up on \ his proposal!

[Judge] Take Mr. von Karma up?

[Karma] On his... proposal?

[Phoenix] Exactly, Your Honor!

[Phoenix] I would like to cross- \ examine the witness's \ pet parrot!

[Judge] O-order! Order!

[Judge] Uh... well, what do you \ think, Mr. von Karma?

[Karma] Need you even ask!? \ This is a farce! \ I object!

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Wait a second!

[Phoenix] You were the one who suggested \ I cross-examine the parrot, \ von Karma!

[Phoenix] I have a right to do as \ you suggested!

[Karma] Mmph...

[Karma] ...

[Karma] Well, if you're so desperate, \ then please, be my guest.

[Phoenix] !

[Karma] Of course, should you go \ through with this...

[Karma] And nothing comes of it, \ then I hope you're ready \ for the consequences.

[Maya] Nick... this is crazy!

[Karma] Well? \ Still want to go through \ with your little game!?

***Yes, I'm doing it************************

[Phoenix] Let the parrot take the \ stand.

[Phoenix] I will cross-examine her, \ Your Honor.

[Judge] !

[Karma] This is the most ridiculous \ thing I have ever heard!

[Phoenix] (von Karma's rigged every \ person's testimony, every \ piece of evidence...)

[Phoenix] (Except the parrot! She's \ my last chance!)

[Phoenix] (At least... I think so.)

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***No, maybe not.***************************

[Phoenix] (You know, come to think \ of it...)

[Phoenix] (This is a really stupid \ idea.)

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk...

[Karma] I've heard of desperate \ men grasping at straws...

[Karma] But this is the first \ time I've heard of men \ grasping at macaws! Hah!

[Phoenix] (Think! von Karma is a \ perfectionist in all things.)

[Phoenix] (He's probably rigged every \ piece of evidence and all the \ testimonies...)

[Phoenix] (If I can't do the unexpected \ I've no chance of winning!)

[Phoenix] Your Honor. \ I've thought about this \ proposal...

[Phoenix] And I'm going to do it. I'm \ going to cross-examine the \ parrot!

[Judge] !

[Karma] Ridiculous!

[] CONTINUE

[Judge] Bailiff! \ Bring in the parrot.

[] ...

[Judge] That's... quite a bird.

[Judge] Please tell us your name?

[Parrot] "..."

[Judge] Name!

[Parrot] "..."

[Judge] The witness is ignoring me.

[Phoenix] (It must hurt... to be \ ignored by a bird.)

[Judge] Ahem. Very well, witness...

[Judge] Who is your owner? \ Please, er... testify for us.

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Certainly the most concise \ testimony we've had so far.

[Judge] Very well, begin your \ cross-examination.

[Phoenix] Right...

[Maya] What are you going \ to do, Nick?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] I... I don't know! \ What do we do, Maya?

[Maya] Hmm...

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- Who Is Your Owner? --

[Parrot] (1) \ "Hello! Hello!" \ *squawk*

[Phoenix] Witness! You can't just \ say "hello" and expect us \ to get anywhere!

[Phoenix] I want you to testify!

[Phoenix] Maya, you talk to her.

[Maya] R-right! \ Uh... What do I say?

***"Have we forgotten something?"***********

[Phoenix] (Remember... two days ago...)

[] ---------...

[Maya] Pol-ly, Pol-ly. \ Have we forgotten something?

[Parrot] *squawk*

[Parrot] "Don't forget DL-6!" \ *squawk*

[] ---------...

[Phoenix] (If I can get Polly to say \ that here...!)

[Phoenix] (That will prove that the \ caretaker had something \ to do with DL-6!)

[Maya] Um, Polly? Have we forgotten \ something?

[Parrot] "..."

[Parrot] "..."

[Parrot] "Hello! Hello!" \ *squawk*

[Maya] ...!

[Maya] Th-that's not what you're \ supposed to say!

[Maya] Forgot! Something we forgot!

[Parrot] "Hello! Hello!" \ *squawk*

[Maya] Uh oh. It's not working, Nick! \ She won't say it!

[Phoenix] (This is ridiculous! \ Why won't she say it!?)

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk... \ Something the matter, \ Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] (Wait...)

[Phoenix] (Don't tell me von Karma \ expected this!)

[Phoenix] (He couldn't have retrained \ the parrot... could he!?)

[Phoenix] (Did he train her not to \ respond when we asked if \ we'd forgotten anything!?)

********************************************

[Judge] Mr. Wright...

[Judge] I think we've established that \ this parrot is named "Polly."

***Of course********************************

[] * -Judge \ * Why, that's today's date. \ * Fifteen years ago!

[] * -Phoenix \ * And the number on that \ * safe is 1228!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Witness, you're here to \ speak! You must speak \ to me!

[Parrot] "..."

[Karma] Frankly, I can't believe \ that you're speaking to \ the parrot.

[Maya] W-well...

[Maya] I guess we should try to \ get some information out \ of her!

[Maya] We need to show the judge \ that her owner is Mr. Yogi!

[] ...

[] AFTER ESTABLISHING BOTH NAME AND SAFE NUMBER CONNECTIONS

[Judge] That's enough!

[Judge] I think we've reached \ a conclusion here.

[Karma] This is a mere coincidence, \ that's all!

[Judge] True, that is a possibility.

[Judge] However, two coincidences \ at the same time seems more \ like a "pattern" to me.

[Karma] Wh... what are you saying!?

[Judge] Summon the caretaker \ of the boat shop.

[Judge] Immediately!

[] ...

[Judge] Witness...

[Judge] Tell us your name.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Wait!

[Karma] This witness, he doesn't \ remember...

[Uncle] No... it's okay.

[Phoenix] ...!

[Uncle] I've accomplished what \ I wanted to do. I'm done.

[Maya] Nick! He looks totally \ different!

[Phoenix] This is the real Yogi, \ I think. Finally.

[Phoenix] He's been acting feeble to \ hide his true identity.

[Phoenix] Acting... for 15 years!

[Judge] W-well...!

[Judge] Let me ask you again.

[Judge] Please state your name \ for the court!

[Yogi] My name... is Yanni Yogi.

[Yogi] 15 years ago, I served as \ a bailiff in this very court.

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] Yanni Yogi!

[Judge] So was it you who killed \ Robert Hammond...?

[Judge] And tried to frame Miles \ Edgeworth for his death?

[Yogi] ...

[Yogi] Yes. \ It was me. I did it.

[Yogi] ...

[Yogi] They put me on the witness \ stand 15 years ago...

[Yogi] Robert Hammond... he said \ I was mentally unsound.

[Yogi] He told me it would make \ me innocent. Get me off \ the hook.

[Yogi] So... I pretended to have \ brain damage...

[Yogi] I was innocent, really! \ But he didn't believe me!

[Yogi] We won the trial... \ But I lost everything.

[Yogi] I lost my job, my fiancee, \ my social standing...

[Yogi] ...

[Yogi] Then, this year, 15 years \ later...

[Yogi] A package arrived. It was \ a letter... and a pistol.

[Yogi] The plan was written out \ in careful detail.

[Yogi] It was a plan for me to \ take my revenge on the \ people who ruined my life.

[Yogi] I didn't care who had \ sent it.

[Yogi] I thought this was my chance, \ after 15 years, this was it!

[Yogi] Finally, a chance to have my \ revenge on Robert Hammond \ and Miles Edgeworth...

[Yogi] I have no regrets.

[Judge] W-wait a moment!

[Judge] Revenge... against Miles \ Edgeworth?

[Judge] What do you mean?

[Yogi] I'm not at liberty to \ speak on that matter.

[Yogi] Why don't you ask Mr. \ Edgeworth yourself?

[Yogi] Anyway, I admit it, I was the \ one who killed Robert Hammond.

[] ...

[Judge] von Karma... \ Where is Mr. Yogi?

[Karma] Under arrest, Your Honor.

[Karma] I saw no room for error \ in his confession.

[Judge] Then... the defendant, \ Miles Edgeworth is...

[Karma] Innocent. \ In this case, at least.

[Judge] Hmm.

[Judge] Very well.

[Judge] Will the defendant please \ take the stand?

[] ...

[Judge] There are a few mysteries \ left unsolved.

[Judge] Still, you are cleared of \ suspicion for this particular \ case.

[Judge] So I would like to pass \ judgment on the murder of \ Mr. Robert Hammond.

[Judge] Any objections?

[Phoenix] ...

[Edgeworth] ...

[Karma] ...

[Phoenix] (I don't believe it!)

[Phoenix] (Why isn't von Karma saying \ anything?)

[Judge] Very well.

[Judge] This court finds the \ defendant, Mr. Miles \ Edgeworth...

[] N O T   G U I L T Y *

[Judge] That is all. \ The court is adjourned!

[] ...

[] *OBJECTION!*

[Judge] D-did someone just say \ "objection"?

[Phoenix] (It wasn't von Karma...!)

[Phoenix] (Wait, but that means...)

[Phoenix] No...

[Phoenix] Edgeworth!?

[Edgeworth] Your Honor.

[Edgeworth] I object to your judgment.

[Judge] Wh-what do you mean?

[Edgeworth] I'm not innocent at all!

[Edgeworth] As we have heard, Yanni Yogi \ killed Robert Hammond in \ revenge.

[Edgeworth] But, revenge for what?

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] Edgeworth is trying to \ confess! He's going to \ say he's guilty!

[Maya] He's going to tell them \ he was the murderer in \ the DL-6 Incident!

[Maya] He's going to tell them \ he killed his own dad!

[Phoenix] (Uh oh! What do I do?)

***Raise an objection***********************

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] The judgment has already \ been passed! I object to \ Edgeworth's outburst...

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Didn't something like this \ happen yesterday, too?

[Karma] I believe a certain witness \ raised an objection after a \ guilty verdict was passed.

[Phoenix] (That would be Larry...)

[Karma] We must hear this new \ statement!

[Karma] We must hear Miles Edgeworth!

[Judge] He's right.

[Judge] We have a duty to hear \ Mr. Edgeworth out.

***Leave it to Edgeworth********************

[Phoenix] (No... I'm sure Edgeworth \ thought about this one \ long and hard.)

[Edgeworth] For fifteen years...

[Edgeworth] I have had a recurring \ dream.

[Edgeworth] A nightmare... it's only \ a nightmare. That's what \ I told myself.

[Edgeworth] But now I know, it wasn't \ a dream.

[Edgeworth] Yanni Yogi wasn't the killer.

[Judge] You mean... in the incident \ where your father died?

[Edgeworth] From the distance of the \ shot, it wasn't suicide, \ either.

[Edgeworth] Everything was as clear \ as day.

[Edgeworth] The murderer...

[Edgeworth] The criminal in the DL-6 \ Incident...

[Edgeworth] It was me!

[Edgeworth] Your Honor! \ I confess my guilt!

[Edgeworth] I am guilty for DL-6, the \ statute of limitations of \ which ends today!

[Edgeworth] The culprit...is me!

[Judge] Order! Order!

[Judge] This is certainly unexpected!

[Judge] The defendant, declared \ innocent, is confessing \ to a different crime!

[Judge] A crime for which the statute \ of limitations runs out today!

[Judge] I'm not really sure how \ I should deal with this...

[Karma] Bah!

[Karma] It's obvious.

[Karma] We hold a trial. \ Right here. Right now.

[Karma] We try this man for his \ crime of fifteen years ago!

[Edgeworth] Miles Edgeworth... \ I am a prosecuting attorney.

[] WITNESS TESTIMONY \ -- The DL-6 Incident --

[Edgeworth] (1) \ That day, I had gone to the \ courtroom to observe one of \ my father's trials.

[Edgeworth] (2) \ As we went to leave, an \ earthquake struck, trapping \ us in the elevator.

[Edgeworth] (3) \ My father and Mr. Yogi \ lost their composure, and \ began to argue.

[Edgeworth] (4) \ Just then, something heavy \ fell at my feet.

[Edgeworth] (5) \ I picked it up, and threw \ it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted \ them to stop fighting.

[Edgeworth] (6) \ A moment later, there was \ a single gunshot, then \ a scream.

[Edgeworth] (7) \ It was a terrible scream. \ I remember it to this day.

[Edgeworth] That's all.

[] ...

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] And, until now, you thought \ this memory was a "dream"?

[Edgeworth] We were stuck in that \ elevator for five hours.

[Edgeworth] The oxygen in the elevator \ ran out, and I lost my \ memory of the events.

[Karma] Bah! The same claim Mr. Yogi \ has made!

[Judge] Very well.

[Judge] Mr. Wright? Your cross- \ examination, please.

[Phoenix] Yes, Your Honor.

[] ...

[] CROSS EXAMINATION \ -- The DL-6 Incident --

[Edgeworth] (1) \ That day, I had gone to the \ courtroom to observe one of \ my father's trials.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What was the trial your \ father was involved in \ on that day?

[Edgeworth] I don't remember things \ very clearly.

[Edgeworth] Only two things...

[Edgeowrth] I know my father lost, \ and Mr. von Karma was the \ prosecuting attorney.

[Judge] Mr. von Karma? You were \ handling that case?

[Karma] It was fifteen years ago. \ I don't remember the details.

[Phoenix] (That was when Edgeworth \ pointed out the problem in \ von Karma's evidence...)

[Edgeworth] (2) \ As we went to leave, an \ earthquake struck, trapping \ us in the elevator.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] So, there were three people \ including yourself trapped in \ that elevator?

[Edgeworth] Yes. Myself, my father, \ and Yanni Yogi.

[Edgeworth] We were fine at first...

[Edgeworth] But then as time passed, \ and no one came to help...

[Edgeworth] (3) \ My father and Mr. Yogi \ lost their composure, and \ began to argue.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What did you do then?

[Edgeworth] I was a nine-year old \ boy at the time. \ What could I do?

[Edgeworth] I was scared... \ Trembling, in the corner.

[Edgeworth] But then...

[Edgeworth] (4) \ Just then, something heavy \ fell at my feet.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] What was it?

[Edgeworth] A pistol.

[Edgeworth] I assume it was the bailiff, \ Yanni Yogi's.

[Edgeworth] The safety must have come \ off when it fell from his \ holster.

[Karma] And you picked it up. \ What happened next?

[Edgeworth] (5) \ I picked it up, and threw \ it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted \ them to stop fighting.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] Did you know it was \ a pistol when you threw it?

[Edgeworth] I think I knew. \ I knew it was dangerous.

[Edgeworth] But... the air was getting \ so thick. I panicked.

[Karma] So, you're saying that you \ threw the pistol at Mr. Yogi.

[Edgeworth] I was... in a daze.

[Edgeworth] (6) \ A moment later, there was \ a single gunshot, then \ a scream.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] The gun fired once?

[Edgeworth] Yes...

[Edgeworth] I think... after I threw \ it, I lost consciousness.

[Edgeworth] Since then...

[Edgeworth] They've echoed in my \ head, every day.

[Edgeworth] That gunshot, and \ that horrible scream.

[Phoenix] The scream...

[Edgeworth] (7) \ It was a terrible scream. \ I remember it to this day.

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] "To this day"...?

[Edgeworth] Yes. I can practically \ hear it now.

[Edgeworth] I doubt I will ever \ forget that scream \ as long as I live.

[Phoenix] (There it is!)

[Phoenix] (One part of that testimony \ clearly contradicts the \ evidence...)

[Phoenix] (But I don't know what \ it means...!)

[Phoenix] (I'd better find out, \ and quick...)

[] ...

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Are you sure you only \ heard one gunshot?

[Edgeworth] Yes. I'm sure of that.

[Edgeworth] I heard the shot, and \ the scream...

[Edgeworth] Then everything faded.

[Edgeworth] I was unconscious until \ the rescuers came.

[Judge] I see...

[Phoenix] But that doesn't make \ sense!

[Phoenix] Look at this file one more \ time.

[Phoenix] This plainly contradicts the \ witness's testimony.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] You do enjoy dragging \ out that file, don't you?

[Karma] I don't accept this evidence! \ Unless... you can tell us \ what page it's on!

[Karma] Which page contradicts \ Miles Edgeworth's testimony?

***"Case Summary"***************************

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk... \ Looks like your luck \ has run out.

[Judge] Mr. Wright...

[Judge] This page has no \ contradictions that \ I can see!

[Phoenix] W-wait! There is a \ contradiction in \ the file!

[Karma] Then show us the right \ page! Even my grandchild \ could do better than you!

[Phoenix] W-wait! There is a \ contradiction in \ the file!

[Karma] Then show us the right \ page! Even my grandchild \ could do better than you!

********************************************

[Phoenix] Look at the "Victim Data" \ in this file!

[Phoenix] It says it quite plainly: \ "the murder weapon was \ fired twice"!

[Phoenix] Miles Edgeworth only heard \ one gunshot!

[Phoenix] Yet, the murder weapon was \ fired twice!

[Phoenix] The first shot was the \ accidental firing when \ the pistol was thrown.

[Phoenix] So... who fired the \ remaining shot!?

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Was there, perhaps, another \ shooter who fired that second \ shot?

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Your Honor. \ As I'm sure you're aware...

[Karma] This incident occurred \ fifteen years ago. The \ evidence is dated...

[Karma] The pistol did fire twice.

[Karma] However, we do not know \ WHEN that second shot \ was fired.

[Karma] It might have been fired \ the day before the incident!

[Karma] There is no proof that the \ second shot had anything to \ do with this incident!

[Phoenix] (What...!)

[Judge] Hmm... I see, I see.

[Judge] You do have a point. \ Mr. Wright?

[Judge] The murder weapon was fired \ twice, as we have heard.

[Judge] One of those shots was fired \ by the defendant, a boy \ at the time.

[Judge] Do you have any proof that \ the other shot fired had \ something to do with the case?

***Yes**************************************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***No***************************************

[Phoenix] (Grr... I didn't think \ of that.)

[Phoenix] I, uh, don't have proof.

[Karma] Hah! As I suspected!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] Given that all this happened \ fifteen years ago, it's \ doubtful any proof remains.

[Maya] Nick! \ Take a look at this!

[Phoenix] The Court Record...?

[Maya] Look... doesn't this \ make you think...

[Phoenix] Wh-whoa! \ (She's right! That is \ strange!)

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] Your Honor. I think I will \ be able to show you proof.

[Karma] Wh-what!? \ Impossible!

[Judge] Now, now, Mr. von Karma. \ Save your surprise for after \ you've seen the evidence.

[Judge] Very well, Mr. Wright. \ Show us your proof.

[Judge] Do you have evidence that the \ second firing of the pistol is \ related to this incident?

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Judge] Mr. Wright...

[Judge] Please, think how we feel \ having to look at this \ evidence time and time again.

[Judge] Every time you show us \ ridiculous evidence, I feel, \ well, mocked.

[Phoenix] Hah hah... Uh, I mean, \ I really don't mean any \ harm by it, Your Honor.

[Judge] "Not meaning any harm"...

[Judge] and "not doing any harm" \ are two differnt things, \ Mr. Wright.

[Judge] Try again, Mr. Wright.

[] RETURN TO COURT RECORD

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] Look at this photograph.

[Judge] This is a photograph of \ the scene of the crime, \ fifteen years ago.

[Judge] I can see that the victim \ lying there is Gregory \ Edgeworth...

[Phoenix] This proves the murder \ weapon was fired twice, at \ the time of the incident!

[Phoenix] This photo proves it!

[Karma] ...

[Judge] ...

[Judge] So, let me get this straight. \ This photo proves two shots \ were fired? Where?

[Phoenix] (Y-Your Honor, please... \ Please get a clue!)

[Phoenix] (Show the judge the \ contradiction in \ the photo!)

***Present somewhere wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] Well, I think... \ it's here!

[Judge] ...

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] Yes?

[Judge] Your eyes have a habit of \ shifting back and forth \ when you're uncertain.

[Judge] Try taking a deep breath, \ and think this over once more.

[Phoenix] R-right, Your Honor.

[] RETURN TO PHOTO

********************************************

***Present Gregory Edgeworth****************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] It's here... I think.

[Judge] You mean the victim... \ Gregory Edgeworth?

[Judge] Gregory Edgeworth was shot \ once... and he died, as we \ can see here.

[Judge] What's strange about that?

[Phoenix] (Er... Maybe I need to be \ more specific here.)

[Judge] Once more, please!

[] RETURN TO PHOTO

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] As should be obvious, \ the contradiction is here.

[Judge] I see... a bullet \ hole in the door...

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] Gregory Edgeworth was killed \ by a shot from the pistol!

[Phoenix] Yet, there is also a bullet \ hole in the elevator door!

[Phoenix] We also know that the murder \ weapon was fired twice!

[Phoenix] Thus...

[Phoenix] Someone other than Edgeworth \ fired that second shot!

[Judge] O-order! Order!

[Judge] Mr. Wright! \ What are you driving at?

[Phoenix] It's simple, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] At the time of the incident, \ two shots were fired.

[Phoenix] One went into Gregory \ Edgeworth's heart.

[Phoenix] The other hit the \ elevator door.

[Phoenix] Remember that the defendant \ lost consciousness after \ the shot he fired rang out.

[Phoenix] In conclusion...

[Phoenix] We must agree that the second \ shot was fired by someone \ else!

[Judge] M-Mr. Wright! \ But who could that \ someone else be!?

[Phoenix] The murderer, of course!

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] ...

[Karma] I knew I should have stepped \ in before your wild fantasies \ got out of hand.

[Karma] Mr. Wright...

[Karma] Look once more at the DL-6 \ Incident case file. Look \ closely.

[Karma] Try the "Case Summary" page.

[Phoenix] (The "Case Summary"... \ that's on page 1.)

[Karma] Look what is written there!

[Karma] "Not a single clue was found \ on the scene."

[Phoenix] ...!

[Karma] If the pistol had indeed \ been fired two times...

[Karma] Then the other bullet would \ have been discovered on \ the scene!

[Judge] He does have a point.

[Karma] That second bullet has \ never been found!

[Karma] Why?

[Karma] Because the second bullet \ does not exist!

[Karma] The bullet that claimed \ Gregory Edgeworth's life was \ the one fired by his own son!

[Karma] That is the truth of this \ matter. The whole truth.

[Karma] It was undoubtedly something \ else that made that bullet \ hole in the door.

[Judge] Order! I will have order!

[Judge] ...

[Judge] Mr. Wright has proven one \ thing to us quite clearly...

[Judge] That the murder weapon was \ fired twice at the time of \ the incident.

[Judge] However!

[Judge] As Mr. von Karma says, the \ second bullet fired was not \ found.

[Judge] It is highly unlikely that the \ police merely overlooked this \ second bullet.

[Judge] So, all we have is the single \ bullet fired.

[Judge] I'm afraid I have to discount \ the defense's claim.

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk...

[Karma] I praise the judge for his \ wisdom in this matter.

[Phoenix] (Gah! How did this happen!?)

[Phoenix] (I don't believe that the \ second bullet didn't exist!)

[Phoenix] (Was I wrong?)

[Phoenix] (Have I been wrong about this \ whole incident?)

[Maya] What are you doing, Nick!?

[Maya] Why aren't you raising an \ objection!?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] I'm sorry, Maya.

[Maya] What?

[Phoenix] I... It looks like \ I was wrong.

[Maya] Nick...?

[Phoenix] If the second bullet wasn't \ tehre, then all my conjectures \ are for nothing!

[Maya] N-no...

[Maya] But you said you'd do it, \ Nick! You said you'd get \ Edgeworth declared innocent!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] I'm sorry...

[Phoenix] It's just, when I saw the \ photograph, I thought that \ two shots had been fired.

[Phoenix] I was so certain of it. \ I thought I'd won!

[Phoenix] I thought there was another \ person, someone else who \ fired the killing shot.

[Phoenix] But now...

[Phoenix] I was wrong to think it \ could be that simple.

[Phoenix] This case has stood unsolved \ for fifteen years!

[Maya] Nick...

[Judge] Well, it seems that we have \ finally cleared up this \ incident.

[Judge] Only one bullet was found \ at the scene of the crime.

[Judge] That shot was fired by \ Miles Edgeworth.

[Karma] Precisely.

[Judge] I would like to ask one \ thing of Miles Edgeworth \ before passing my verdict.

[Judge] Have you been paying attention \ to the trial so far?

[Edgeworth] Yes, Your Honor.

[Judge] Do you have any objections?

[Edgeworth] No... No, I do not.

[Judge] So you killed your father, \ though that was not your \ intention?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Yes, I did.

[Maya] ...

[Maya] Oh no...

[Maya] He's confessing...

[Maya] ...

[Judge] Very well.

[Judge] The statute of limitations on \ the murder of Gregory \ Edgeworth runs out today.

[Judge] Therefore, I must pronounce \ a verdict on the defendant \ today, right here...

[Karma] Right now!

[Judge] Indeed.

[Judge] Does anyone have any \ objections?

[Phoenix] (I've been here before...)

[Phoenix] (It's just like my first \ day in court...)

********************************************

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] Your Honor! \ I... I object!

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk.

[Karma] Mr. Wright, on what grounds \ do you object, hmm?

[Phoenix] Oof!

[Maya] Nick...?

[Phoenix] (I... I don't know! \ His case is perfect!)

[Maya] Oh no...

[Phoenix] Grah!

[] ...it must exist...

[] ...the second bullet...

[Phoenix] !!!

[Phoenix] Wh-what?

[Phoenix] What did you just say?

[Maya] N-nothing!

[Phoenix] (The second bullet must \ exist?)

[Phoenix] (But where!?)

[] ...Someone took it...

[Judge] ...

[Judge] It seems waiting is not \ going to produce us any \ answers from Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] Wait, Your Honor!

[Judge] Hmm?

[Phoenix] I, uh...

[Phoenix] Th-the second bullet! \ It, uh, it exists!

[Judge] What!?

[Judge] But we've just heard proof \ that it did not exist!

[Phoenix] I-I realize that, Your Honor.

[Phoenix] (I'm really grasping here!)

[Phoenix] I-it's just, someone took it \ from the scene of the crime! \ That's what happened!

[Judge] But... \ Who!?

[Phoenix] Th-th-the murderer!

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] The murderer? Then tell us, \ just who is this "murderer"?

[Phoenix] I'm... still thinking about \ that one.

[Judge] Hmm...

[Judge] So the criminal took the \ second bullet? Why would he?

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Judge] First of all, how would \ he have found it?

[Judge] It's not easy to find a \ stray bullet, Mr. Wright!

[Judge] Was there some pressing \ need for the murderer to \ search for that bullet?

***The murderer had to find it**************

[Phoenix] O-of course there was a need. \ That's why he took it!

[Karma] Bah! \ What possible reason \ could he have had!?

[Phoenix] W-well...

[Phoenix] The reason the murderer took \ the bullet away from the \ scene with him is...!

***The bullet would be proof****************

[] * -Phoenix \ * Er... Maybe he thought that \ * the bullet would be used as \ * proof?

[] * -Judge \ * Proof...?

[] * -Phoenix \ * It was a special bullet, \ * so he took it with him...

[] * -Karma \ * *OBJECTION!*

[] * -Karma \ * If that was the case, then \ * he would have taken the bullet \ * from inside Gregory as well!

[] * -Phoenix \ * Huh?

[] * -Karma \ * Why would he only take \ * one of the two shots fired!?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Oh, right.

[] * -Judge \ * Mr. Wright? Have you really \ * thought this through?

[] * -Judge \ * I'm going to have to \ * penalize you!

[] * -Phoenix \ * (Argh... This isn't going \ * so well.)

[] * RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

***The murderer was cautious****************

[] * -Phoenix \ * Uh... Well, the murderer was \ * a very cautious sort, you see.

[] * -Phoenix \ * That's why the murderer had \ * to search for that bullet...

[] * -Karma \ * *OBJECTION!*

[] * -Karma \ * If that was the case, then \ * he would have taken the bullet \ * from inside Gregory as well!

[] * -Phoenix \ * Huh?

[] * -Karma \ * Why would he only take \ * one of the two shots fired!?

[] * -Phoenix \ * Oh, right.

[] * -Judge \ * Mr. Wright? Have you really \ * thought this through?

[] * -Judge \ * I'm going to have to \ * penalize you!

***The murderer didn't need it**************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] (Why would the murderer have \ spent the time to look for \ that stray bullet...?)

[Phoenix] (I haven't got a clue!)

[Judge] What's wrong, Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Uh... Um...

[Karma] Bah! The murderer had no \ reason to take that bullet!

[Karma] You don't want to admit \ it, but it's true!

[Phoenix] Urk...

[] ...had to take it...

[Phoenix] (Had to take it...? \ The murderer? What does \ that mean?)

[] ...you're thinking \ too normal...think \ crazy...

[] ...don't think why \ the bullet was taken...

[] ...think why the \ bullet HAD to be \ taken...

[Judge] Mr. Wright?

[Phoenix] Y-yes, Your Honor! \ (I have no idea what I'm \ doing...)

[Phoenix] U-uh, well, the murderer had \ no intention of taking the \ bullet from the scene.

[Phoenix] But... uh, the murderer HAD \ to take that bullet.

[Judge] "Had to," Mr. Wright? \ What do you mean?

[Phoenix] Well, for instance...

[Phoenix] (For instance WHAT!?)

[Phoenix] Uh, maybe the bullet, uh... \ hit the murderer?

[Judge] The bullet... hit the \ murderer?

[Phoenix] J-just saying, for instance.

[Phoenix] I mean, if it hit you, you \ would have to take it with \ you, wouldn't you?

[Phoenix] It's not like you could \ perform surgery right there.

[Phoenix] Y-y'know?

[Judge] ...

[Karma] ...

[] ...

[Phoenix] (Wait a second...)

[Phoenix] (I was just talking off the \ top of my head, but what if \ that's really what happened?)

[Judge] Let me get this straight.

[Judge] So at the time of the murder, \ the murderer himself was shot?

[Judge] And he left with the second \ bullet still inside!?

[Judge] Thus leaving only one bullet \ at the scene of the crime?

[Phoenix] Uh, yes... I guess that's \ how it would work, yes.

[Judge] But there's a problem with \ that!

[Judge] The other two people rescued \ from that elevator...

[Judge] Miles Edgeworth and Yanni \ Yogi were both unharmed!

[Judge] So that would mean...

[Phoenix] The murderer came from \ outside, yes.

[] ---------...

[] The two men fight inside \ the elevator.

[] Trying to stop them, the \ boy pickes up the pistol \ at his feet and throws it.

[] The pistol discharges, \ and the bullet...

[] The bullet goes through \ the elevator door and \ hits the murderer outside!

[] The boy loses consciousness...

[] Then the murderer opens the \ elevator door and sees the \ men inside...

[] ---------...

[Judge] Hmm.

[Judge] Mr. Wright. You are truly the \ most unpredictable defense \ attorney I've ever known.

[Judge] I can tell you're grasping, \ yet I cannot deny the \ possibility of what you say.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] What are you saying! \ Deny it! Deny it!

[Karma] No one involved with the \ incident was wounded!

[Karma] There was no "murderer"!

[Judge] Hmm...

[Phoenix] (No one was wounded at the \ time of the incident...)

[Phoenix] (He's right. I can't think \ of anyone...)

[Maya] Hey, Nick.

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Maya] I just thought of something \ really crazy.

[Phoenix] Crazy?

[Maya] Remember what Mr. Grossberg \ said yesterday?

[] ---------...

[Grossberg] Gregory Edgeworth dealt a blow \ to his perfect trial record.

[Maya] Wow.

[Grossberg] It must have been quite \ a shock for von Karma.

[Grossberg] He took a vacation for \ several months after that, \ you see.

[Grossberg] Yes, an unusual event \ for the man.

[Grossberg] That was the first, and the \ last vacation he's taken in \ his many years of prosecuting.

[] ---------...

[Maya] What if von Karma didn't \ take that vacation because \ of shock...

[Phoenix] But took it because he \ was injured!

[Maya] Which would mean...

[Phoenix] It could only mean one thing!

[Maya] He was the murderer in \ the DL-6 Incident!

[Phoenix] He was the man who shot \ Gregory Edgeworth!

[Maya] It was... von Karma!

[Phoenix] (Oh man!)

[Judge] Something wrong, Mr. Wright? \ You seem... dazed.

[Phoenix] Uh, n-no, Your Honor.

[Judge] Well?

[Judge] You have indicated the \ possibility that the \ murderer came from outside.

[Judge] Can you give us the \ name of your suspect?

[Phoenix] (Uh oh. Should I come out \ and say it now!?)

***Say it now*******************************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Save it for a better time****************

[Phoenix] (Wait... I don't have \ enough proof yet.)

[Phoenix] (This is my trump card, \ I'd better save it for \ the right time.)

[Judge] Mr. Wright? \ Something the matter?

[Phoenix] I-I'm fine, Your Honor.

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk...

[Karma] Shall we carry on with the \ trial then, hmm?

[Karma] That said, we have no \ farther to go. All that \ is left... is the finish.

[Karma] In other words... \ the verdict!

[Phoenix] Wh-what! Not yet!

[Karma] Think, Mr. Wright.

[Karma] You have said that someone \ from the "outside" was the \ murderer.

[Karma] Yet you cannot suggest anyone \ as a possible suspect!

[Karma] Which means your conjecture... \ is worthless.

[Karma] And will be rejected. \ Of course.

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] Now's no time to be holding \ on to that trump card!

[Maya] The trial's almost over!

[Phoenix] A-alright! I may not know \ what I'm doing... but here \ goes!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] Your Honor!

[Phoenix] There is a suspect... \ one lone suspect!

[Karma] ...

[Judge] Well, this is certainly \ interesting news.

[Judge] Very well, Mr. Wright.

[Judge] Who is your suspect?

[Phoenix] V-V-V...

[Phoenix] (Urk! My h-hands are shaking!)

[Judge] V-what?

[Phoenix] von Karma!

[Edgeworth] von Karma!?

[Karma] ...

[Judge] ...

[] ...

[Judge] You mean, THE von Karma? \ The prosecutor? Sitting \ right there?

[Karma] Bah.

[Judge] You... don't object?

[Karma] Hmph.

[Karma] I see no need. \ Why honor this ridiculous \ outburst with my objection?

[Phoenix] Because you took a vacation \ for several months starting \ the day after the incident!

[Phoenix] Yet you pride yourself \ on a perfect record!

[Phoenix] Why would you take such a \ long vacation without any \ reason!?

[Karma] So you're claiming that I \ took a vacation to heal my \ "injury" from the incident?

[Karma] Fascinating!

[Karma] Prove it.

[Karma] I would have needed surgery, \ no? Where did I go under the \ knife at, Mr. Wright?

[Karma] Bring the doctor that \ operated on me! Have \ him testify!

[Phoenix] Urk...

[Maya] Nick!

[Maya] Let's find out who this \ doctor is!

[Edgeworth] It's no use.

[Phoenix] E-Edgeworth!?

[Edgeworth] I know von Karma. \ Perhaps too well.

[Edgeworth] He's perfect. \ He wouldn't leave clues.

[Edgeworth] He probably didn't undergo \ surgery.

[Edgeworth] That would leave a doctor \ as a witness.

[Phoenix] (Grr... Nobody's that \ perfect!)

[Maya] So... so what, Nick?

[Maya] Did von Karma pull the \ bullet out by himself!?

[Maya] That's insane!

[Phoenix] No... he couldn't have.

[Phoenix] You can't just pull bullets \ out of yourself!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] (Wait...)

[Phoenix] (What does that mean...?)

[Phoenix] (That bullet has to be \ somewhere! But... where?)

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk... \ Well, Mr. Wright!

[Karma] Can you produce evidence to \ prove that I was shot?

***It's impossible to prove*****************

[Phoenix] (It would be impossible to \ find the doctor who operated \ on von Karma now...)

[Phoenix] (Even if von Karma did \ undergo surgery!)

[Karma] Hmph! It seems you have \ finally come to your senses.

[Karma] You've realized the truth: \ You can't prove something that \ didn't happen!

[Phoenix] (Urk!)

[Maya] Nick...

[] ...the Court Record...

[] ...there must be \ something...

[Phoenix] (The Court Record...? \ What could be in there!?)

[Phoenix] (Gah! There's no time! \ I'd better think on it \ as I go...)

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Show evidence****************************

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

[Phoenix] Alright, von Karma, \ I'll prove it.

[Phoenix] And I'll even use evidence... \ I know how you like it so \ much.

[Karma] Wh-what!?

[Phoenix] The evidence that proves \ von Karma was shot is...!

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Karma] What exactly is that?

[Phoenix] Er... Sorry.

[Karma] Judge, if you would?

[Judge] Right. Penalty!

[Phoenix] (I'm really not sure how \ I've managed to make it \ this far...)

[Judge] Mr. Wright, please reconsider \ your evidence.

[Phoenix] Y-yes, Your Honor.

[] RETURN TO COURT RECORD

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Phoenix] von Karma is perfect... \ He wouldn't risk surgery, \ leaving an evidence trail.

[Phoenix] So then, I ask, where \ is that bullet now?

[Phoenix] I think it unlikely that \ von Karma performed surgery \ on himself!

[Judge] ...!

[Judge] You... you don't mean!

[Phoenix] I do.

[Phoenix] There is a possibility that \ the bullet is still inside \ von Karma!

[Judge] I-is that even possible? \ For all these years!?

[Phoenix] Well, there's one way \ to find out.

[Phoenix] We could use this \ metal detector!

[Phoenix] Well, von Karma?

[Phoenix] I'm going to run this over \ you, and see what we find.

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] ...

[Karma] I... refuse!

[Judge] Y-you refuse...!?

[Judge] But, refusing this means...

[Judge] You acknowledge that the \ bullet is still inside you?

[Judge] Order! Order! Order!

[Phoenix] Your Honor! The defense \ requests that we be allowed \ to use the metal detector!

[Karma] *OBJECTION!*

[Karma] Judge! I call for a suspension \ of this trial! This is an \ invasion of privacy!

[Phoenix] *OBJECTION!*

[Phoenix] The statute of limitations \ runs out on this case today!

[Phoenix] It was you who said we had to \ end it right here, right now!

[Karma] Mm... mmmph!

[Judge] Enough!

[Judge] I permit the use of the \ metal detector.

[Judge] Mr. von Karma, you will submit \ yourself to testing!

[Maya] Nick! \ What does this mean...?

[Phoenix] I don't know... but we \ have to give it a shot!

[] ---------...

[] ...

[] *beep* *beep* *beeeeeep*

[Phoenix] (It reacted! Something's \ inside his right shoulder!)

[Phoenix] (The bullet!)

[] ---------...

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Mr. von Karma...?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] You!

[Edgeworth] It was you!

[Karma] ...

[Karma] I was afraid this would \ happen.

[Karma] And so, I remained silent.

[Phoenix] ...?

[Karma] Indeed, there is a bullet \ in my shoulder.

[Karma] However... it has nothing \ to do with this incident!

[Phoenix] What!?

[Karma] I was shot in the shoulder \ long before the DL-6 Incident!

[Karma] I claim that the bullet in \ my shoulder has no relation \ to DL-6!

[Judge] B-but, Mr. von Karma! \ Can you prove that?

[Karma] "Prove"?

[Karma] I have no obligation to \ prove anything!

[Karma] It is you who must prove \ something here, Mr. Wright!

[Karma] Not I.

[Judge] M-Mr. Wright?

[Judge] Well? Can you prove it?

[Judge] Can you prove that the \ bullet in von Karma's \ shoulder was from DL-6?

[Karma] Of course he can't!

[Karma] You don't have any of \ the DL-6 evidence!

[Phoenix] (That's because you took \ it out of the Records Room \ yesterday!)

[Karma] With no proof, you cannot \ convict me of any crime!

[Karma] So sorry, Mr. Wright.

[Phoenix] No... I'm the one who's \ sorry, Mr. von Karma.

[Karma] Wh-what!?

[Phoenix] You were close... one day \ away from freedom.

[Phoenix] You see... I have proof!

[Karma] Wh-what!?

[Phoenix] Who would have thought you \ would have dug your own grave \ trying to convict Edgeworth!

[Phoenix] I can link that bullet in \ your shoulder to the DL-6 \ Incident...

[Phoenix] And here's my final proof!

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Maya] N-Nick...?

[Maya] Umm... If this is your final \ proof, don't you think you \ should choose a little better?

[Phoenix] Huh? You mean, that was the \ wrong evidence?

[Phoenix] Everyone looks kinda \ puzzled...

[Judge] Mr. Wright.

[Judge] ...

[Phoenix] (Uh oh, he's really mad.)

[Maya] I think you'd better dig \ out the right evidence, \ and quick!

[Phoenix] R-right!

[Phoenix] You got lucky, von Karma, \ but this next one is the \ real evidence, okay!?

[] RETURN TO QUESTION

********************************************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Judge] Th-that's...

[Judge] A bullet?

[Karma] Where did you get that!?

[Phoenix] This is the bullet used \ in the DL-6 Incident.

[Phoenix] This was taken from the heart \ of the victim, Mr. Gregory \ Edgeworth.

[Phoenix] The bullet is preserved quite \ nicely, with all the ballistic \ markings intact.

[Edgeworth] Ballistic markings...

[Phoenix] You may recall the term.

[Phoenix] It came up in the first trial, \ two days ago.

[] ---------...

[Judge] Ballistic markings are the \ fingerprints of a weapon.

[Judge] All bullets fired from a gun \ are marked with that weapon's \ unique pattern.

[Judge] By examining the markings, \ you can tell which weapon \ fired the bullet.

[Judge] It's quite accurate.

[] ---------...

[Phoenix] We have two bullets \ in our possession.

[Phoenix] One, the bullet removed \ from Gregory Edgeworth's \ heart.

[Phoenix] The other, Mr. von Karma, \ is the bullet buried in \ your shoulder.

[Phoenix] We could analyze both \ bullets...

[Phoenix] Then, if the markings \ matched...

[Phoenix] We would know that both \ bullets had been fired \ from the same gun!

[Phoenx] The very same pistol... in \ other words, the murder weapon \ that killed Gregory Edgeworth!

[Karma] Mmmph... mmmph!

[Phoenix] Mr. von Karma?

[Phoenix] You will let us remove \ the bullet from your \ shoulder.

[Phoenix] Then we'll compare the \ ballistic markings to those \ on this bullet...

[Phoenix] And solve this case once \ and for all!

[Phoenix] Well, Mr. von Karma!?

[Karma] Mmmrrrrrrgggh!

[Karma] Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaa \ aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

[Karma] Uaaaaarrrr... aaa... oooh. \ Worrrrrrrggg... aaa... oooooh...

[Edgeworth] That scream...

[Edgeworth] I've heard that scream \ before...

[Edgeworth] Wait... I know!

[] ---------...

[] "H-help! I can't breathe!"

[] "Quiet! I said quiet! \ You're not making this \ any easier!"

[] "Stop breathing my air! \ I'll... I'll stop you!"

[] "Stop breathing my aaaaair!"

[] (Get away...!)

[] (Get away from my father!)

[] *BANG*

[] Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaa \ aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

[] ---------...

[Edgeworth] It's that scream I heard \ in the elevator!

[Edgeworth] Fifteen years ago...

[Edgeworth] von Karma! \ It was you who screamed!

[Judge] Mr. von Karma?

[Karma] Wooorrrrrrroooorgggh.

[Karma] Eh...Edgewoooooorrth......... \ ...Ehh...Edgewoooooorrth......

[Karma] Only...you would... \ dare...defy me...!

[Edgeworth] So... it was you!

[Karma] You and your father \ are my curse!

[Karma] Your father shamed me with \ a penalty on my record!

[Karma] And you... you left a scar \ on my shoulder that would \ never fade!

[Karma] I... I'll bury you! \ I'll bury you with my bare \ hands! Death! Death!

[] ---------...

[] Fifteen years earlier...

[Karma] Mr. Chief Prosecutor... \ I am sorry.

[] von Karma! It's not like \ you to make this kind of \ error...

[] I never would have thought \ that Edgeworth would be the \ one to catch you.

[Karma] I... was careless.

[] I'm sorry, but you will \ have to be penalized.

[] I've covered for you in \ the past, but not this \ time.

[Karma] ...!

[Karma] Edgeworth!!!

[] ---------...

[] It was a shock like \ none I had ever known.

[] Me? Penalized!?

[] It took hours for me to \ regain my composure.

[] Suddenly, I found myself \ in the darkness...

[] I was in the court \ records room.

[] I must have wandered in there \ without thinking where I was \ going.

[] The room was pitch black. \ The lights must have gone out.

[] I went out in the hall and \ felt my way to the elevator.

[] I pressed the button, \ and nothing happened.

[] Then... there was a noise!

[] I was in pain! \ A horrible, burning pain \ in my shoulder!

[] Just then, the lights came \ back on. The elevator door \ opened before my eyes.

[] I saw three people inside, \ all lying unconscious from \ oxygen deprivation.

[] Much to my surprise, a pistol \ lay at my feet.

[] I knew then... \ it was destiny.

[] In his last moments, \ Gregory Edgeworth was \ still unconscious.

[] He died, never knowing \ who had shot him.

[] Later, he spoke through a \ medium, blaming Mr. Yogi.

[] He was fooled! \ It was the perfect crime!

[] ---------...

[Karma] Tsk tsk tsk...

[Karma] Who would have thought another \ man would have come to open \ that elevator door?

[Karma] Judge!

[Judge] Wh-what?

[Karma] What are you doing!?

[Karma] Do you job! Bring an end \ to this miserable charade!

[Karma] Now! End it!

[Judge] V-very well.

[] ...

[Judge] It appears that we have come \ a very long way to the end \ of this maze.

[Judge] Fifteen years later...

[Judge] Mr. Miles Edgeworth?

[Edgeworth] Yes, Your Honor.

[Judge] You were innocent. \ You are innocent.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Judge] As you said, it was \ all a "nightmare."

[Edgeworth] Yes, Your Honor.

[Judge] This court finds the \ defendant, Mr. Miles \ Edgeworth...

[] N O T   G U I L T Y *

[Judge] That is all. \ The court is adjourned!

[Maya] Nick! Nick! We did it!

[Maya] Did you see his face!? \ von Karma looked even paler \ than usual!

[Maya] He's pretending to be all \ cool, but inside you crushed \ him, Nick! Crushed!

[Maya] I gotta say, I'm impressed.

[Phoenix] Heh... It was pretty close, \ though.

[Phoenix] I was sure we'd had it.

[Maya] I know, I was on the \ verge of tears the \ whole time, myself.

[Maya] But now it's all just \ a good memory!

[Edgeworth] ...

[Phoenix] So, it's finally over, \ Edgeworth.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Wright.

[Phoenix] Yeah?

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] I... \ I'm not sure how to say this.

[Maya] I know! I know! \ Try "thank you."

[Edgeworth] I... I see.

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] Th-thank you, Wright.

[Phoenix] Y-you're welcome.

[Maya] I think you could have \ done better than that!

[Edgeworth] Oof! S-sorry... \ I'm not good at \ this sort of thing.

[Maya] You got a lot to learn, \ Edgeworth!

[Phoenix] (Dear, dear...)

[Gumshoe] Whoooooooooooooop!

[Gumshoe] Amazing, pal! You pulled \ through just like I thought \ you would!

[Gumshoe] I'll never forget this! \ I owe you one, pal.

[Gumshoe] And tonight, let's party! \ Dinner's on me!

[Gumshoe] Yeah, my salary went down \ a bit this month...

[Gumshoe] But who cares!

[Maya] See, Mr. Edgeworth? \ You should take a lesson \ from Detective Gumshoe!

[Maya] That's how you say \ "thank you"!

[Edgeworth] Mmm. \ I... I see.

[Edgeworth] *ahem*

[Edgeworth] Whooooooooooooop!

[Edgeworth] ...

[Edgeworth] I... I feel foolish.

[Maya] Don't worry. Take it \ a little at a time. \ You'll get used to it.

[Phoenix] (It's been fifteen years \ since I've seen Edgeworth \ this... unguarded.)

[Lotta] Hey, y'all!

[Maya] Lotta!

[Lotta] Y'all were great in there!

[Phoenix] Thank you!

[Lotta] Yo, Edgeworth! \ Congrats!

[Edgeworth] Er... thank y'all very much.

[Lotta] I knew you were innocent \ from the start, of course.

[Lotta] Just look at you! You wouldn't \ stick your hand in the cookie \ jar even if no one was there!

[Edgeworth] You... were the witness \ on the first day of the \ trial, weren't you.

[Lotta] Yeah, well, let bygones \ be bygones, eh?

[Phoenix] Speaking of which, what \ are you doing now, Lotta?

[Lotta] Who, me? Aww, I went \ back to college.

[Lotta] I gave up trying to be \ an investigative photographer \ pretty quick.

[Phoenix] Really? That's too bad.

[Lotta] Huh?

[Phoenix] ?

[Lotta] Isn't that the hotdog \ guy from the park?

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Butz] It's over, Nick! \ My life is over!

[Phoenix] Wh-why the sad face, \ Larry!? What happened \ now!?

[Butz] Oh, Nick... \ I'm not long for this world.

[Phoenix] Uh... you don't look sick...

[Butz] It's Kiyance! Sh-she's goin' \ to live in Paris! Paris, Nick!

[Butz] She's leaving me behind!!!

[Phoenix] (Larry, Larry...)

[Butz] Yo, Edgey! There you are!

[Edgeworth] Um, yes, here I am.

[Butz] Congrats, Edgey! \ Here... a little gift from \ me in celebration!

[Edgeworth] Celebration? That's unusual \ for you.

[Gumshoe] Harry Butz! You come along \ tonight too! My treat, pal!

[Butz] Huh? Uh... thanks! \ Looking forward to it!

[] Butz \ (Yo, yo, Nick!)

[Butz] (That's the suit that \ questioned me!)

[Butz] (When he says treat... that's \ not police-talk for prison \ food, right? Right?)

[Phoenix] Uh, I think you'll \ be fine, Larry.

[Edgeworth] Wright...

[Phoenix] Yeah? What's up?

[Edgeworth] That envelope that Larry \ gave me. It's got money \ in it.

[Phoenix] Well, yeah. That's not that \ strange. People give money \ away to celebrate sometimes.

[Edgeworth] It's $38.00, Wright.

[Phoenix] Huh. What a weird amount. \ I mean, it's not a little, \ but it's not a lot either.

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] $38.00 exactly?

[Maya] N-N-Nick!

[Maya] Wasn't that exactly the amount \ of lunch money that was stolen \ from Mr. Edgeworth in school!?

[Phoenix] $38...!

[Phoenix] No...

[Phoenix] No!!! \ Larry, it was you!!!

[Edgeworth] What are you so surprised \ about, Wright?

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Edgeworth] Larry was absent that day \ from school, right?

[Edgeworth] But that doesn't automatically \ rule him out as a suspect.

[Phoenix] What?

[Edgeworth] Think back to that day, \ fifteen years ago.

[Edgeworth] Larry took the day off, but \ he was bored, he came in to \ school anyway.

[Edgeworth] Then he saw the money \ lying there... and the \ rest is history.

[Butz] I never was good at History! \ Heh...

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Edgeworth... you didn't \ know, did you?

[Edgeworth] I suspected.

[Edgeworth] I just couldn't picture Larry \ protecting you like he did \ that day.

[Edgeworth] Everyone else was saying \ you did it. The whole class \ was against you, remember?

[Phoenix] Yeah... too well.

[Edgeworth] Wright, you may not know this, \ but we used to have a saying \ back in school.

[Edgeworth] "When something smells, \ it's usually the Butz."

[Phoenix] I know, I know.

[Edgeworth] Really, Wright. I'm surprised \ you didn't figure it out!

[Butz] Well, this is sure an \ unexpected turn of \ events, eh?

[Phoenix] Edgeworth...

[Edgeworth] Hmm?

[Phoenix] You should have told me!

[Maya] Now, now, Nick. It was \ fifteen years ago!

[Maya] Don't you think the "statute \ of limitations" has run out, \ Mr. Edgeworth?

[Edgeworth] I'd say so, yes.

[Butz] There you have it!

[Phoenix] Grr...

[Phoenix] Where does that leave me!? \ I became a defense attorney \ because of what you two did!

[Edgeworth] Well, I'd call you a \ goody-two-shoes to the \ extreme.

[Butz] Yeah! And you get worked up \ too easily, too!

[Phoenix] D-death! The death sentence \ for both of you!

[Phoenix] Man, if I only had known, I'd \ have become a prosecutor!

[Edgeworh] The same goes for me, only \ the other way around...

[Edgeworth] For the longest time, \ I thought that I might \ have killed my own father.

[Edgeworth] I thought I might be \ a criminal.

[Edgeworth] I became a prosecutor in \ part to punish myself.

[Edgeworth] If I had known the truth, \ I might have become a \ defense attorney after all.

[Phoenix] Edgeworth...

[Edgeworth] Want to switch, Wright?

[Lotta] Hey, y'all! \ Line up, I'll take a photo!

[Maya] Hey, photo time! \ Let's go!

[Gumshoe] And after that, dinner on me!

[] ---------...

[Phoenix] Detective Gumshoe took us \ out on the town that night.

[Phoenix] We celebrated Edgeworth's \ new found freedom.

[Phoenix] Although, Edgeworth \ was still in detention.

[TYPEWRITER] <t> #green December 29, 5:02 AM \ Wright & Co. Law Offices

[Phoenix] Whoa... I went a little \ overboard yesterday.

[Phoenix] My head hurts...

[Phoenix] Huh? It's still only 5:00. \ Maybe I should go back to \ sleep...

[Phoenix] Hmm?

[Phoenix] (What's this? A letter?)

[] ---------...

[Maya] Good morning, Nick.

[Maya] You were really impressive \ yesterday.

[Maya] Seeing you...

[Maya] It made me think about \ what I'm doing here.

[Maya] I'm a spirit medium... \ in training, of course.

[Maya] I wanted to help \ Mr. Edgeworth too.

[Maya] I wanted to help you.

[Maya] But I couldn't. \ I was useless.

[Maya] So, I've decided to go \ back to my training.

[Maya] I'll become a full-fledged \ spirit medium, for starters.

[Maya] I couldn't say it to your \ face, so I left this letter.

[Maya] Goodbye, Nick.

[] ---------...

[Phoenix] (G-goodbye!?) \ What time is it?

[Phoenix] Gah! The first trains for \ the mountains have already \ left! To the station!

[] ...

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] I guess I'm too late...

[Phoenix] ...

[Maya] Hey!

[Maya] N-Nick!

[Phoenix] Maya!

[Maya] ...

[Phoenix] ...

[Maya] ...

[Phoenix] So... you're leaving?

[Maya] Yeah.

[Maya] It's hard being a spirit \ medium who can't talk to \ spirits.

[Maya] And...

[Maya] I think you'll do fine \ without me, Nick.

[Maya] Be good... okay!

[Phoenix] *HOLD IT!*

[Phoenix] W-wait!

[Maya] What?

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] I never could have saved \ Edgeworth without your \ help.

[Maya] Huh?

[Phoenix] On the last day of the \ trial... I heard her. \ I heard Mia's voice!

[Maya] You heard my sister...?

[Phoenix] Yes... only her voice, \ but still...

[Phoenix] It was at the very end \ when I thought we'd \ lost everything.

[Maya] Well, that's my sister \ for you.

[Maya] Detective Gumshoe helped, \ and Mr. Grossberg, and \ even Larry...

[Maya] I'm the only one who couldn't \ help. I was useless, Nick.

[Phoenix] But you were the one who \ stopped von Karma, Maya!

[Maya] Huh?

[Maya] I-I didn't do anything!

[Maya] All I did was wander \ around in a daze...

[Phoenix] Sorry, but I have evidence \ that you helped!

[Maya] E-evidence?

[Phoenix] (Show Maya some evidence \ to cheer her up!)

***Present something wrong******************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Maya] ...

[Maya] Huh?

[Maya] S-sorry, Nick. I guess \ I don't understand.

[Phoenix] (Uh oh! Now that I think \ about it I don't understand \ this evidence either!)

[Maya] It's okay. You don't have \ to try and cheer me up.

[Maya] But...

[Maya] One day, I'll come back \ and be useful, I promise!

[] CONTINUE

********************************************

***Present DL-6 Bullet**********************

[Phoenix] *TAKE THAT!*

[Maya] A bullet...?

[Phoenix] von Karma was convinced he \ had taken all of the evidence \ pertaining to DL-6!

[Phoenix] But you were the one who \ rescued the last piece of \ evidence we needed!

[Phoenix] This was the bullet that \ put an end to von Karma!

[Phoenix] And you were the one \ who gave it to me!

[Maya] Nick...

[Phoenix] Thanks, Maya. I couldn't \ have done it without you.

[Maya] ...

[Maya] ...

[Maya] I'll be back soon.

[Phoenix] Huh?

[Maya] I'm going to complete my \ training, and come back!

[Phoenix] ...

[Phoenix] Okay. I'll be waiting.

[Phoenix] ...

[Maya] Of course you will. You can't \ run that office by yourself! \ You're hopeless!

[Phoenix] Uh, I don't know about that...

[] CONTINUE

[Maya] So... bye.

[Phoenix] Bye.

[] Now a new story begins...

[] With the same old crazy \ cast of characters...

[] ---------...

[Edgeworth] Hah! Don't think you've \ graduated yet, amateur!

[Judge] Mr. Wright. \ Perhaps you'd like to \ rethink that claim?

[Phoenix] Er... yes, Your Honor. \ (Uh oh... I got a bad \ feeling about this...)

[] Episode five \ 'rise from the ashes'

[] it's been two months since Maya left the office... Two months without a single \ trial. I've had offers... But none I took. That is... until the day that girl \ showed up.

***
[] February 22, 10:02 AM, Wright & Co. Law Offices \ (Why do I come here to the office every day?) \ (it's not like I want to work...)

[] *A girl who looks like Maya but wearing lab coat over school uniform and pink \ thick rimmed glasses appears* \ ???: There you are! Finally! \ ???: Where have you been!? \ ???: My sister's trial is tomorrow! \ Phoenix: ... \ Phoenix: ... \ Phoenix: Um... Who are you? \ ???: It doesn't matter who I am! It only matters who YOU are! \ ???: You're famous defecse attorney, Mia Fey! \ Phoenix: ... \ ???: ... \ Phoenix: ... \ ???: Oh, uh... You're not Mia Fey, are you? \ Phoenix: I'm sorry but Ms. Mia Fey no longer... works here. \ ???: So you are...? The coffee boy? \ Phoenix: I'm Phoenix Wright... A defense attorney. \ ???: Wright... Wright... Wait! \ ???: You're THE Phoenix Wright!? \ ???: The Phoenix Wright from the Edgeworth murder case?! \ Phoenix: Um, yes, that's correct. (It wasn't Edgeworth who was murdered, \ though...) \ ???: That's a relief then! You're better than nobody! \ Phoenix: I'm sorry... I'm afraid I'm not taking cases right now. \ ???: But, you are Phoenix Wright, right? \ ???: The undefeated defense attorney? \ Phoenix: Look, I'm not accepting any new cases. \ Phoenix: I'm sorry, but you'll have to try elsewhere. \ ???: Please! I'm out of time! \ Phoenix: But... \ ???: Please, you have to help! I- it's my sister! \ Phoenix (sees the shadow of Maya): ...! \ Phoenix (backflashes to Mia's death scene where Maya was helplessly caught in \ the situation): (Maya...? Could it be...?) \ Phoenix: ... \ Phoenix: Okay. I'll here you out. \ ???: R - Really?! Thank you so much! \ ???: My name's Ema, Ema Skye. I'm a scientific investigator. \ Phoenix: (Scientific investigator?)

[] *Chose from one of the following: \ Examine \ Move \ Talk \ Present

[] EXAMINE: \ Window \ Phoenix: Looks like it's cleaning day agay at the hotel across the way. I hear \ they're planning a second branch outside the city. Egads! The bellboy waws \ staring right at me.

[] Plant \ Phoenix: Mia's plant, "Charley." I've been taking care of him in Maya's \ absence.

[] Poster \ Phoenix: There's a poster of the Steel Samurai on the wall. Maya stuck it up \ here on the day she left. I didn't have the heart to take it down. \ Ema (smiles): ... \ Phoenix: I do sometimes get strange looks from the clients, though.

[] Bookcase \ Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stands in a formidable row. They mock \ me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped \ out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.

[] Desk \ Phoenix: Mia's desk. I sit here even less now that I've stopped taking cases. \ I ought to at least dust it off once in a while.

[] TALK:

[] Ema \ Phoenix: Ema, was it? So you're a "scientific investigator"? \ Ema: Yes! That's right! Is... something wrong? \ Phoenix: No, it's just, you seem kind of, er, jumpy. Or maybe just... young? \ Ema: Young? \ Ema: I'll be sixteen years old this year! \ Phoenix: Oh, I see... Wait! Only sixteen!? \ Ema: I'm set to be formally assigned to Forensics in three more years. \ Ema: My work is becoming quite well known... at my age, no less! \ Phoenix: Um, so what exactly is your current position, then? \ Ema: Well, legally speaking... \ Ema: I guess you'd call me an "eleventh grader". \ Ema: But I'm ready to do my job! At my age, no less! \ Phoenix: (Great, another future professional in training...)

[] The Case \ Phoenix: So what's this about a case? You siad the trial's tomorrow? \ Ema: My sister didn't do it! She wouldn't stab someone with a knife! She \ wouldn't! \ Phoenix: So... it's a murder case. \ Ema: I don't care if there's a witness who saw her do it! She didn't do it! \ Ema: I know she didn't do it! It's a scientific fact! \ Phoenix: And... here's a witness. \ Ema: J- Just talk to her! You have to talk to her! \ Phoenix: Right... I suppose I will. \ Ema: I promised her I'd bring Mia Fey, but... \ Phoenix: (That's interesting...) \ Phoenix: How would she know Mia?)

[] Sci.Investigator \ Phoenix: So, you want to be a scientic investigator when you grow up, then? \ Ema: E-excuse me? \ Ema: I'm not a child, I'll have you know! \ Phoenix: Still, it's good to have a goal. Albeit a very unusual one. \ Ema: I believe investigations should be done scientifically! \ Ema: Don't you? \ Phoenix: Uh, yeah. (Sure can't fault her for a lack of enthusiasm.) \ Ema: If this case is handled scientifically, I'm sure my sister's name will be \ cleared! \ Phoenix: Your sister?... \ Ema: I've been doing research, you know! \ Ema: I'm developing a new scientific method of case investigation! \ Ema: I'll show you when I'm done! \ Phoenix: I'm looking forward to it. \ Phoenix: (Guess I should get down to the detention center and talk to her \ sister.)

[] Relation to Mia \ Ema: My sister asked for her specifically. \ Ema: Mia Fey... was a few years below her in school. \ Phoenix: (So she went to the same school as Mia.) \ Ema: She always told me to go to Mia if I ever needed a defense attorney... \ Ema: And, well... I need one. \ Phoenix: Um, incidentally, Mia is a woman. \ Ema: Mia... Yeah, I thought it was a little weird when I saw you, too. \ Phoenix: Well, it's nice of you to help your sister out like this. You must be \ close. \ Ema: ... \ Phoenix: ? \ Ema: Well... \ Ema: Actually, when she gets like she is now, I kind of hate her. \ Phoenix: (huh?) \ Ema: But... But she's my only family. \ Phoenix: Your only family? What about your parents? \ Ema: They died in a car accident when I was little. \ Phoenix: Oh... I'm sorry

[] PRESENT

[] Attorney's Badge \ Phoenix: See this? It's my Attorney Badge. \ Ema: Ahh! Well! I've never seen a real one before. \ Phoenix: (You're the first one who's actually been interested in mine, believe \ me.) \ Ema: Its composition is mostly silver. the gold plating is flaking a bit. \ Phoenix: (She analyzed it. Scientifically...) \ Ema: There doesn't appear to be any corrosion due to sulfides I'd give you $50 \ for it. \ Phoenix: Sorry, but it's not for sale. Yet...

[] MOVE \ To: Detention Centre

***
[] February 22 \ Detention Center \ Visitor's Room

[] Ema: ... \ Phoenix: (Hmm, I wonder what's wrong with Ema?) \ Phoenix: ( She got quiet all of sudden as soon as we arrived.) \ ???: Guard... I thought I told you I didn't want visitors. \ Guard: S-s-s-sorry, ma'am! It's j-j-j-just, your sister... \ ???: No excuse! \ ???: Or did you not want a raise this year, hmm? \ Guard: U-u-u-understood, ma'am! \ Phoenix: (Wh-wh-wh-what was that all about?) \ *A woman who looks just like Mia, but wearing proscutor oufit appears* \ Ema: H-hi, Lana. \ ???: Funny. \ ???: I seem to remember specifically telling you NOT to come here. \ ???: Perhaps my memory is failing? \ Ema: L-look... \ Ema: I didn't want to come here either, okay? \ Ema: But your trial's tomorrow and you still don't have a defense attorney! \ ???: I'll be the one in court tomorrow. This has nothing to do with you, Ema. \ ???: Isn't that right, Mr. Wright? \ Phoenix: Hey! How do you know me? \ ???: Mia mentioned you. I've heard... Quite a bit. \ Phoenix: Er, I'm sorry. What exactly is it that you do...? \ ???: My name is Lana, Lana Skye. \ Lana: I'm the Chief Prosecutor for this district. \ Phoenix: Y-you're a prosecutor!? \ Phoenix: (Two sisters... one a lawyer. Could this be a coincidence?) \ Phoenix: (Ema... Lana... I mean, they are just like...) \ Ema: Is something wrong, Mr Wright?

[] *Chose the following: \ Examine \ Move \ Talk \ Present

[] EXAMINE

[] Camera \ Phoenix: Smile for the camera...

[] Guard \ Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He's frozen ihn fear of the \ frigid Miss Lana. I'm feeling a bit chilly myself.

[] TALK

[] The Case \ Lana: There's something you should know from the start. \ Phoenix: W-which is? \ Lana: The suspect in this case has confessed to the crime. \ Phoenix: Huh? \ Ema: W-wait! But the suspect... The suspect is...! \ Lana: Me. I did it. Well. Mr Wright? \ Phoenix: Well... Why don't you begin by telling me exactly what happened. \ Lana: The crime took place yesterday, February 21, at 5:51PM. \ Phoenix: That's quite specific. \ Lana: It was in the witness's deposition. \ Lana: A witness clearly saw me commiting the crime. \ Phoenix: Uh... My, that was a bit of bad luck, wasn't it? \ Lana: The crime took place in the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's \ Office. \ Lana: The body was found in the trunk of my subordinate's car. \ Phoenix: The Prosecutor's Office, huh? (In your subordinate's car trunk? \ Classy...) \ Lana: I was arrested on the spot. Caught red-handed, as it were. \ Phoenix: (My, my...)

[] The Victim \ Phoenix: So, who was the victim? \ Lana: An investigator with the Police Department. \ Lana: I suppose the correct term is "Detective." \ Ema: A detective...? \ Lana: Death was due to a loss of blood. He was stabbed once in the stomach. \ Phoenix: By... you? \ Lana: Death wasn't immediate, but the wound was fatal. \ Phoenix: I see... \ Lana: Allow me to repeat myself, Mr. Wright. The victim was a detective. \ Lana: You know what that means, don't you? \ Phoenix: Uh oh! \ Ema: What? Mr. Wright? What does it mean? \ Phoenix: Well, it means... \ Lana: The police department will consider it a matter of pride to have me found \ guilty. \ Lana: They will use any means at their diposal to do so. \ Phoenix: (This case gets worse and worse with everything I learn.)

[] Lana \ Phoenix: So, you're the Chief Prosecutor? \ Lana: that is correct. \ Lana: I'm responsible for overseeing every trial handled by prosecutors in this \ district. \ Lana: I make sure the prosecutors have what they need to do the job, and manage \ every aspect. \ Lana: Those are my responsibilities in a nutshell. \ Phoenix: (That's an awfully large nutshell.) \ Lana: Still, I'm a little surprised. \ Lana: I would think you'd recognize the district's Chief Prosecutor, Mr. \ Wright. \ Phoenix: Huh? \ Lana: In fact, it seems impossible you wouldn't... \ Ema: Um.... Lana? What happened to your hand? \ Lana: Oh, this? \ Lana: I cut myself by accident. When I stabbed him, that is. \ Ema: Huh? \ Lana: I'm not very good at  being a criminal, I suppose. \ Phoenix: (How am I susppose to defend this!?) \ Phoenix: (Time to change the subject...) \ Phoenix: (Wait, she ws in the class ahead of Mia, wasn't she...?

***
[] Relation to Mia \ Phoenix: Um, you were in school with Mia, correct? \ Phoenix: A few years above her? \ Lana: ... Ema told you that, too, did she? \ Ema: W-well, why not? I did drag him all the way here from his office! \ Lana: Although it seems he has very little in common with Mia... \ Phoenix: (Hey!) \ Lana: It was in law school. I was in my third year, and she was auditing the \ class. \ Lana: She was different than the other students. \ Phoenix: Different? \ Lana: She was strong... She'd do anything to become a defence attorney. \ Anything. \ Lana: That... was probably why she was attracted to me. \ Phoenix: E-excuse me!? \ Ema: Intellectually attracted! Lana was top of her class in school. \ Lana: I was the best there was. \ Phoenix: Oh... \ Ema: I'm doing pretty good in school too, by the way! \ Phoenix: (It sounds a bit different when Ema says it...) \ Lana: Well, Mr Wright? \ Phoenix: E-excuse me? \ Lana: As you can plainly see, I am admitting my guilt. \ Lana: I think it's safe to say... there's no way you can take this case. None. \ Ema: B-but, Lana! \ Lana: ... \ Ema: You ... you were always this way, weren't you? \ Ema: You never think of anyone but yourself. \ Lana: ...! \ Ema: I know you didn't do it, Lana. I know! \ Ema: So... So how can you say you did!? \ Lana:... \ Ema: If I lose you... \ Ema: I'll be all alone! \ Ema: I... I hate you, Lana. \ Lana:... \ Lana: Mr Wright. \ Phoenix: Y-yes? \ Lana: I believe our discussion here is ended. \ Lana: The rest... I leave to you. \ Phoenix: ...! \ Phoenix: Um... You mean, you're requesting my services as your defense? \ Lana: Don't lose any sleep over it.. Your clkient has confessed, after all. \ This case is over. \ Phoenix: Right... I'll do what I can to get to the bottom of this. \ Lana: ... \ Phoenix: (Lana has confessed to the crime, yes...) \ Phoenix: (But something doesn't fit.) \ Phoenix: (It's that look in Ema's eyes.) \ Phoenix: (There's something else going on here... and I'm going to find out \ what!)

[] Back at Phoenix Wright's office

***
[] Ema: I'm sorry, Mr Wright. \ Phoenix: Huh? About what? \ Ema: My sister... she's not alwyas like this you know. \ Phoenix:... \ Phoenix: I just never expected to be defending another prosecutor again. \ Ema: She's changed a lot. \ Ema: She used to be so gentle, always smiling. Everybody liked her. \ Phoenix: I see... (Sorry, but I'm having trouble imaginning that.) \ Phoenix: What happened to her? \ Ema: I don't know for certain myself... \ Ema: I think maybe she.... Well, maybe not. \ Phoenix: (sounds like there's something there that defies a simple scientific \ explanation.) \ Phoenix: Lets go check out this underground parking at the Prosecutor's Office, \ shall we? \ Ema: O- Okay!

[] February 22 \ Prosecutor's Office \ Underground Parking Lot

[] Phoenix: So this is the lot where it all happened? \ Ema: Looks like they're still investigating... \ Phoenix: (Funny that my first visit to the Prosecutor's Office should be like \ this...) \ Ema: Hey everyone! Keep up the good work! \ Phoenix: H-hey! What are you thinking? \ Ema: Well, they are going to be my coworkers three years from now and all. \ Ema: No harm in saying hello... \ Phoenix: Actually, there is. You know attorneys aren't suppose to examine crime \ scenes? \ Phoenix: I'm trying to not stand out too much, here, see? \ ???: Hey there! \ ???: You 'specting to go unnoticed here, pardner? \ Ema: P-Pardner? \ a longhaired man wearing cow boy hat, Indian leather shore and a red badanna \ appears* \ ???: Looks like a bambina got loose from the ranch and is up to no good! \ ???: Folks gotta learn to keep them dogies tgied down, pardner. \ Ema: M-Mr Marshall! \ Phoenix: (Marshall? Looks more like a sheriff to me...) \ ???: Lookie here, bambina. I know how you feel. \ ??? : but this is my gang's gold strike, see? \ Ema: Strike...? \ ???: This is our claim, our territory. And the goldmine is... evidence. \ ???: If you're fixin' toi mess with what's ours... You'll regret it, pardner! \ ???: You know what dreams the cacti out in the desert dream? you want to? \ Phoenix: (What's this guy talking about!?) \ ???: You head along home now. Happy trials, bambina! \ Phoenix: ... \ Ema: ... \ Phoenix: Was that uh, hombre, a friend of yours? \ Ema: Uh... kind of... sort of... Yeah. He's a detective. \ Phoenix: (Who thinks he's a sheriff from the Wild West it seems.)

[] *Chose from: \ Examine \ Move

[] EXAMINE

[] Step ladder \ Ema: Ah huh! A ladder. \ Phoenix: Um... That's a step ladder. \ Ema: What's the difference? In scientific terms, please. \ Phoenix: S-scientific huh? \ Ema: Look at the basic nature of things, Mr. Wright. \ Phoenix: ( This is all seems so horribly familiar somehow...)

[] Door \ Ema: Look! A door! This must mean something! \ Phoenix: I'm not sure that doors "mean" anything. \ Ema: No! It won't open! a mysterious lock! \ Phoenix: I fail to see what's mysterious about it. \ Ema: Mr. Wright... You need to learn to enjoy life more. \ Phoenix: Lets finish our investigation first, shall we?

[] Entrace \ Ema: This is where the cars leave the lot. \ Phoenix: The arrow on the ground makes it look more like an entrance. \ Ema: What are you talking about? It's plainly an exit! \ Phoenix: Well, maybe it's both. Kind of a dual purpose? \ Ema: Ah huh! The theory of relativity! \ Phoenix: What? Uh... \ Ema: I've got to write this down. Ah! Hey, hey, Mr. Wright! \ Ema: Maybe you know... Was Mr. Relativity, German? Or was he British? \ Phoenix: Mr. Relativity? Are you sure that was his name?

[] Security Room on Floor Above \ Ema: Look! A stylish, glass-walled room! Very nice. \ Phoenix: You could see the whole parking lot from in there. \ Ema: It says "SECURITY." Perhaps it's a cafe? \ Phoenix: Huh? \ Ema: "Cafe Security"... Yeah, that must be it. Lets check it out later! \ Phoenix: Um. I hate to break it to you, but I think that's probablky just a \ security guard office. \ Ema: ... \ Ema: You know, I scored a 97 on my science test the other day! \ Phoenix: (Too bad they don't have a test for common sense...)

[] Telephone on the Wall \ Ema: Here, a phone. Lets see if it works... \ Phoenix: Hey. Don't touch stuff we don't need to be touching. \ Ema: ... I can't hear anything! \ Ema: My ears! No, my ears! Maybe it's due to the barometric pressure... \ Phoenix: (What is she babbling about?) \ Ema: Hey!? What did you just say? \ Phoenix: See, You can hear just fine. The phone's broken!

[] Section Partition \ Ema: The wall is in our way. \ Phoenix: It's got a faucet for water. \ Ema: Wait! I know! \ Ema: This "wall" is merely a facade, hiding the truth... \ Ema: This is no wall, but a water tank!!! \ Phoenix: (I fail to see how it makes any difference either way...)

[] Wallet on the Floor \ Phoenix: What's this? A wallet? \ Phoenix: Um, excuse me! Officer! \ Ema: W-w-waaaait! What are you doing? Mr. Wright!? \ Phoenix: What am I doing? I just found this wallet, so I'm handing it over to \ the police... \ Ema: I don't believe it... \ Ema: This is real basic: Anything at a crime scene is evidence! \ Ema: Let's be scientific about this, please! Just put it in your pocket. \ Phoenix: H-how is that scientific? (Sounds like theft to me!)

[] Wallet hastily sutffed into pocket.

[] Ema: I'm called to duty already, and at my tender age! \ Ema: Here, I'll teach you the trick to examining evidence in detail, okay? \ Phoenix: (By the way her eyes are sparkling I can tell she's been waiting for \ this...) \ Ema: Okay, okay, now. Look at the Court Record! \ Ema: You have to be sure to examine evidence carefully on all sides! \ Ema: Now. Let's start examining! From every angle! \ Ema: Oh look! I think there might be a clue there. You should check it out! \ Press the Examine button. \ Phoenix: This... This is an ID card. \ Phoenix: (detective Bruce Goodman, ID # 5842189) \ Ema: See? Well? Isn't scientific investigation useful? \ Phoenix: I guess... Though I don't see what "science" has to do with it.

[] Goodman's ID added to the Court Record. \ Ema: Let's be sure to examine every piece of evidence we find! \ Phoenix: (I guess I've got to be on my toes from now on...)

[] Oil Drums \ Phoenix: An oil drum. Looks like it's filled with water. \ Ema: I-it's heavy! I can't even budge it! \ Phoenix: The drum over here is on its side. \ Ema: Wait! I know! I'll hide in here and do a stake-out! \ Phoenix: I think you'll probably just get arrested., \ Phoenix: (In fact, you mayh not even have to hide in the drum to get arrested.) \ Ema: What? I'm not suspicious!

[] Letter on the Wall \ Ema: Well, no time to waste! Let's get hunting for clues! \ Ema: Hmm... I wonder what this is? \ ???: Well, pardner.ooks like you got no intention of going home quietly. \ Phoenix: (The sheriff!) \ ???: Like I said before, this here's our claim. \ ???: You'd best be moseying along.Unless you're fixing to bite the bullet. \ Phoenix: (Gah! Scary!) \ Ema: C-could you just tell us one thing...? Who owns that car? \ ???: Well, well. The little filly's got a good nose on her! \ ???: You want to know who rides that red mustang with the body in her saddle, \ eh? \ Ema: Please! \ ???: No problem, pardner. 'Bout time for vittles anyway. \ ???: Get yourself to the saloon up on the 12th floor of the Prospector's \ Office. \ ???: Might just find you a cervesa you  like. \ Phoenix: (Prosepector's Office? Where does this guy think he is? And when, for \ that matter!?) \ Ema: Note to self: look up vittles, saloon, cervesa. \ Phoenix: (Maybe we should check out that roomo 1202... the High Prosecutor's \ Office! \ ???: In any case, stay away from the car. \ ???: You can look around here all you like just keep your paws off our claim. \ Phoenix: (Right... Great.) \ Ema: Grea! Maybe there are some clues around here, Mr Wright! Let's check it \ out!

[] ???: Excuse me? \ ???: Were you two all set? \ Ema: Us? \ *A woman wearing black short suit-dress, white fur collar coat, sushi hat and \ holding a picnic bascket appears* \ Phoenix: (What's this? She couldn't be...) \ Ema: Y-you're selling lunches? Here? This is a crime scene! \ ???: Hello! Half n' Half, was it? \ Ema: Oh. Uh, thanks. \ ???: And you, sir? \ Phoenix: Y-yes? \ ???: Some Crunchy Goodness coming at you! \ Phoenix: Uh... thanks.. (Interesting way of doing business.) \ ???: This area is off limits to anyone without clearance. \ ???: Especially passers-by. Or are you officers? \ Ema: Uh... no, but you... You don't exactly look like the type to have \ clearance. \ ???: Well, that's hardly a way to greet someone! \ ???: Even if my days as the "Cough-up Queen" are over... \ Phoenix: C-cough-up? Huh? \ Ema: You know, I'm feeling kind of full. Maybe I'll pass on lunch... \ ???: I'm quite connected to this case, you see. \ ???: The image are burnd into my eyes, you might say. Yes, all the sordid \ secrets.... \ Ema: Secrets...? \ ???: Dear me. You are a slow one, aren't you? \ ???: I'm referring to the murder.. The stabbing of that detective. \ Phoenix: Whaaaat!? \ *flash back* \ Lana: A witness clearly saw me committing the crime. \ *back to current scene* \ Ema: You mean you are the witness my sister was talking about? \ Phoenix: Please! Cought-up Queen! Tell us what happened! \ Angel: The name is Angel Starr. Don't you go forgetting it. \ Angel: Or before you know it I'll have you whimpering at my heels. \ Phoenix: Y-y-yes, ma'am! (Yipes! She means it!)

[] *Chose one of the following: \ Examine \ Move \ Talk \ Present

[] TALK

[] The Case \ Angel: Somehow... I knew. \ Angel: Yesterday was a day of destiny... I knew something was going to \ happen... \ Angel: Just like I know that the Daily Special on Friday everyon week is \ salmon. \ Phoenix: Destiny...? Was yesterday speciasl for some reason? \ Angel: You're a defense attorney, right? You should know then.' \ Angel: You should know the foul misdeeds of the evil ones who haunt this den of \ inequity! \ Ema: E-evil ones? \ Angel: Prosecutors! They have no qualms at all about blackening the name of \ innocents! \ Angel: And yesterdayt they paid homage to the mot evil one of all! \ Angel: They gave an award for "king of Prosecutors"... What a farce! \ Ema: So, she's saying... \ Ema: There was some sort of prosecutor's convention yesterday. \ Angel: I was almost compelled to lace their lunches with something fould... \ Ema: Do you have  a personal grievance against prosecutors, or something? \ Ema: Or is there some kind of scientific evidence of this, um, "evil"? \ Angel: Young miss... \ Angel: Mock me at your own risk! You'll soon find out why they call me the \ "cough-up Queen"! \ Ema: Ew! \ Angel: The most heinous of all the evil ones, the one they awarded yesterday... \ Angel: It was in his car that they found theh body! \ Angel: Proof that he devours the evilest lunches of all! \ Ema: R-really!? \ Phoenix: (Really what? I'm totally confused...) \ Phoenix: (One thing's clear. This lunch lady has a thing against prosecutors.)

[] What You Witnessed \ Phoenix: So, what exactly was it that you witnessed, Ms.. Starr? \ Angel: It was a fascinating spectacle, to be sure! \ I now feel I know what they say when they talk about a "woman's wrath". \ Angel: To see Lana Skye wield that knife so... \ Phoenix: ! \ Angel: Her knife flashed in anger, bringing him to a sad end. \ Angel: It was truly a sight to see. \ Ema: Y-you mean you saw the very moment of the crim!? \ Angel: The sound of his silvery ties to this world being cruelly cut still \ rings in my ears. \ Angel: And the rhythmic beat of Lana Skye's knife... \ Phoenix: Wait a second! You know Lana Skye? \ Angel: Hmph. Of course. It's quite a feat... becoming Chief Prosecutor./ \ Angel: How many lunchboxes of sin did she pack to make that journey, I wonder! \ Ema: She... always travels light. \ Phoenix: (Now why would this pretty lunch lady know the Chief Prosecutor's \ name?)

[] Angel \ Ema: Um... Could we ask you a bit about yourself, Ms. Starr? \ Angel: I come here every day to sell lunches. \ Angel: I import only the freshest and best from the Far East. \ Angel: For some reason, the box lunches are a hit here. \ Ema: Why not make the lunches here rather than import them? \ Angel: Did you say something? \ Ema: N-no... \ Ema(? This is a possible error of the game): Only true conossieurs can \ understand... \ Angel: The kind you can only tell someone who has tried General Tso's Trilobite \ lunch set. \ Ema: Ah... Nevermind... You win. \ Phoenix: (I don't even want to appreciate part of a trilobite's flavour.) \ Angel: Anyway,, I come here every day to sell lunches. \ Angel: My boyfriend works in the security room here at the Prosecutor's Office. \ Ema: Y-your boyfriend? \ Angel: See the security room over there? \ Phoenix: The glass-walled booth? \ Angel: I sell my lunches and, since I'm here anyway, I drop in to see him. \ Phoenix: (Since yhou're here anyway... I guess selling lunches is more \ important than romance.) \ Ema: So, to scientifically analyse the data available so far... \ Ema: You, Ms Starr, are a lunch vendor with an ulterior motive for coming here! \ Phoenix: (Useful analysis. Not.)

[] Prosecutor's Office \ Phoenix: Did you have a bad experience with a prosecutor, Ms. Starr? \ Phoenix: I sense some... hostility. \ Angel: Hostility? Hah! Perhaps. \ Angel: Prosecutors are all alike. And the bigger they get, the worse they \ smell. \ Angel: Kind of like 10-day old clams in the chowder. \ Phoenix: (I wonder if Ms Starr was involved in some sorts of legal trouble in \ the past?) \ Ema: That'd be a sure cause of food poisoning! Scientifically speaking, of \ course. \ Ema: I mean, now you're talking "Cough-up Queen"! \ Phoenix: ( I thought she was just a lunch vendor, but now I'm not so sure...)

[] PRESENT

[] Attorney's Badge \ Angel: A defense attorney must be able to fight... \ Angel: How about you? Do you think you can win? \ Angel: How about tackling Lunchland's Pickle Supreme lunchbox!? \ Ema: Wow! It's really crunchy! \ Phoenix: (A box of pickles...?Kind of a sad lunch if you ask me.)

[] Goodman's ID

[] Phoenix: About this card... \ Angel: ... \ Angel: Lunchland vendors only accept cash. No cards. \ Angel: Especially not a card belonging to someone else! \ Phoenix: No, no, this isn't a credit card. It's an ID card. It belongs to a \ detective... \ Angel: And you're showing this to me, the lunch lady, why? \ Angel: That's like showing a fine honeyed ham to a detective! \ Phoenix: (Why do I always feel like I'm being mocked?)

[] February 22 \ High Prosecutor's office \ Room 1202

[] Ema: This is the kinb of room that just screams "I can do the job." \ Ema: Quite a change from your office, really. \ Phoenix: Thanks. \ Ema: Look, look! There's a trophy or something here! \ Phoenix: (A trophy? What, that shield?) \ Ema: It takes real nerves to display stuff like this. \ Ema: Whoever's office this is, he must be a real stuck-up jerk! \ ???: Mr. Phoenix Wright. \ ???: You never tire of prying into other people's business, do you? \ Phoenix: (That voice...) \ *Miles Edgeworth appears* \ Phoenix: Long time, no see, Edgeworth. \ Ema: Huh? \ Ema: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! M-M-Mr Edgeworth! \ Phoenix: ...! You know him from somewhere? \ Ema: O-of course! I'm his biggest fan! \ Ema: My sister introduced us once, and.... \ Phoenix: (Right... her sister was the Chief Prosecutor, after all.) \ Edgeworth: Well? What brings you here? \ Edgeworth: I'll wanr you... I've been known to be a real stuck-up jerk... \ Ema: N-no! Did I...? No! \ Ema: It was just, Mr. Wright here, he... \ Phoenix: Hey! Don't blame me! \ Ema: W-we're just here to investigate a murder case! \ Edgeworth: Murder...? \ Ema: A body was found in this nasty,m bright red sports car in the parking \ lot... \ Edgeworth: Hmm? \ Edgeworth: That would be my car. What of it? \ Ema: Whaaaaaaaaaaaa!? Y-y-y-your car!? \ Phoenix: (I'll say one thing, she certainly can scream.)

[] *Chose one of the following: \ Examine \ Move \ Talk \ Present

[] EXAMINE

[] Framed Suit \ Ema: Wow! This jacket is even lacier than his usual ones! \ Ema: This must be his lucky trial jacket! \ Phoenix: Lucky jacket, right... I've never seen him wear it. \ Ema: I'm sure there's a story behind why it's in a frame! \ Ema: Maybe I'll be naughty... and take a picture! \ Phoenix: (She's getting way too excited about this.)

[] Trophy \ Phoenix: I've been wondering... what the heck is this? \ Ema: It has a big "K" on it. \ Edgeworth: *mumbles* of Prosecutors... \ Phoenix: Huh? What's that? \ Edgeworth: It's the "King of Prosecutors" trophy. \ Ema: K-K-K... "King of Prosecutors"!? \ Edgeworth: It's a great honor. They send that shield to the best prosecutor \ each year. \ Edgeworth: What! So? \ Phoenix: So that "K"... That's... \ Ema: "K" stands for "King"? \ Edgeworth: Yeah, you got a problem with that? \ Edgeworth: I didn't design the thing! \ Ema: "King of Prosecutors"... Kind of like "Employee of the Month", only \ better! \ King of Prosecutors Trophy added to the Court Record

[] Couch \ Ema: Mr. Edgeworth has such a comfy sofa! \ Phoenix: Sofas like this make me want to curl up and take a nap. \ Ema: I bet he pours over his case files here until the wee hours of the \ morning... \ Ema: Then he takes  off his jacket, rolls up his sleeves... \ Ema: And goes to sleep using his arms as a pillow! \ Phoenix: (I don't believe it. She's actually daydreaming about Edgeworth \ working...) \ Ema: I bet in the morning he has sofa hair, and little creases in his cheek \ from the seams! \ Ema: He's so cool! \ Phoenix: Sofa-hair is cool!?

[] Items on the Window Bench \ Ema: My, my my! What an amazing bouquet! Just right for Mr.Edgeworth! \ Phoenix: No kidding. Hey, there's a card on it... \ Phoenix: "Back from the Dead -- Wendy" \ Phoenix: ("Wendy"? I've heard that name somewhere before.) \ Ema: And beside it... A giant Steel Samurai! \ Ema: Wow, I want one! \ Phoenix: Huh? There's Something written on the  bottom of his foot. \ Phoenix: "Between a rock and a hard place -- Wendy" \ Ema: Wendy? Is she Mr Edgeworth's fiancee? \ *Image of Wendy Oldbag flashes before Phoenix's eyes* \ Phoenix: Um... I don't think so.

[] Window \ Ema: Whoa! \ Ema: What a view! It must be nice to have an office on the 12th floor. \ Phoenix: I guess you would feel... important. \ Ema: Incidentally.... \ Ema: Were you to jump out this window, the time until impact with the ground \ would be... \ Ema: ... \ Ema: Got it! Approximately 3.23 seconds! \ Phoenix: (That's handy to know...)

[] Desk \ Phoenix: A work desk. It's quite tidy, as one might expect. \ Ema: What a nice desk! Easy to use, and easy on the eyes! \ Ema: It's polished so well I can see my own reflection. \ *image of Dick Gumshoe flashes before Phoenix's eyes* \ Phoenix: (Strange... Why did I just picture Detective Gumshoe?) \ Ema: Maybe I'll take that name plagque as a souvenir. \ Phoenix: Don't. He'll sue you..

[] Teapot \ Ema: Oooh! Cute! What a pretty tea set! \ Phoenix: I go more for the instant tea bags myself. \ Ema: Amazing! The drawer below is filled with packets of tea leaves! \ Ema: They're all sorted by place of origin and flavour! \ Ema: Look at this Royal blend! What a exquisitely splendid concoction! \ Phoenix: (There's such a thing as taking a hobby too far...)

[] Bookcase \ Ema: Whoa! These are all case files!? \ Ema: They're stacked up to the ceiling! There's even a ladder... \ Phoenix: Odd... \ Phoenix: I thought Edgeworth wasn't good with heights. \ Ema: He must have someone get them for him. \ *image of Dick Gumshoe flashes before Phoenix's eyes* \ Phoenix: (Strange... why did I just picture Detective Gumshoe?) \ Ema: He must study these case reports so closely... He's so cool! \ Phoenix: You wouldn't say that if you saw him sweating bullets up on that \ ladder.

[] Chess Set \ Ema: Hey, a chessboard! \ Phoenix: I'm not too up on my chess but it looks like Blue's in a bit of a \ tight spot. \ Ema: The Red Knights have surrounded the Blue Pawn... \ Phoenix: Huh? \ Ema: Those horses are mounted knights. Their swords have really sharp "edges!" \ Ema: And check out that poor pawn, his head is  kind of spiky... Kind of \ reminds me of you. \ Ema: Mr Edgeworth must be an avid chess player! What's wrong, Mr Wright? \ Phoenix: (Edges... surrounding a pwn with spiky hair... Nah... It's nothing.)

[] TALK

[] The Case \ Phoenix: So, the body was found in your car? \ Edgeworth: Go ahead, say it, Wright. \ Edgeworth: You think I did it, don't you. \ Edgeworth: After you went through all that trouble to help me last year, no \ less. \ Ema: N-no, we don't think you did it! \ Ema: I mean, it was my ssiter who stabbed him.... \ Ema: Uh, wait, no, she didn't do that! I mean... \ Edgeworth: So you're the Chief Prosecutor's little sister, then? \ Ema: Y-yes, sir! Ema Skye! It, uh... \ Ema: It's nice to meet you again! \ Phoenix: (Now that didn't sound forced at all...) \ Edgeworth: Ah, now I remember. You've ... really grown. \ Edgeworth: I'll admit, it was a surprise to me, too. \ Edgeworth: To think that my own car would become the scene of a murder. \ Edgeworth: More surprising still... \ Edgeworth: Now I'm forced to prove my superior's guilt. \ Phoenix: I can understand... W-wait... What did you say!? \ Edgeworth: Lana Skye is the Chief Prosecutor... the top prosecutor in the \ district. \ Edgeworth: She can't prosecute herself, so I'll be the prosecutor at the trial \ tomorrow. \ Ema: You!? Mr Edgeworth...

[] Edgeworth \ Edgeworth: To be honest... \ Edgeworth: It's a bit of a miracle I'm still here at all. \ Phoenix: What do you mean? \ Edgeworth: Rumours. \ Edgeworth: You've heard tghe remours about me, haven't you? \ Phoenix: (Miles Edgeworth...) \ Phoenix: (It's hard to remember a time when there WEREN'T rumours about this \ guy...) \ Phoenix: (Forging evidence, arranging false testimony, illegal searches, you \ name it...) \ Edgeworth: Thanks to you, my innocence was established in the trial at the end \ of last year. \ Edgeworth: However, there are some who say I'm the one responsible for the \ current incident. \ Phoenix: Wh-what? That's crazy! \ Edgeworth: Hmph. \ Edgeworth: Some people need very little excuse to think ill of others. \ Edgeworth: It's a fact of life. Impossible to stop. \ Ema: But... \ Edgeworth: Some of them even go so far as to present me with toys like this... \ Edgeworth: They think it's funny. \ Phoenix: (Toys? That bronze shield? There's got to be a story behind that \ one...)

[] Lana Skye \ Edgeworth: Chief prosecutor Skye? Yes... we first worked together on a case two \ years ago. \ Edgeworth: It was my first big case. \ Ema: That's right, I remember. \ Phoenix: (Two years ago... I wasn't even a lawyer yet.) \ Edgeworth: Since then, I always felt that she was looking out for me... \ Edgeworth: It appears I was mistaken. \ Ema: M-mistaken!? Why? \ Ema: I mean, I know she's not the warmest person... \ Ema: But I'm sure she felt some responsibilities for you! \ Edgeworth: Then... Why? \ Edgeworth: Why did she stab someone in the trunk of my car? \ Edgeworth: Not only that... She stabbed him with my knife. \ Ema: Wha...Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr Edgeworth! Your knife was the murder weapon!? \ Edgeworth: To be specific, it was the knife kept in toolbox in the trunk of my \ car. \ Edgeworth's Knife added to the Court Record. \ Phoenix: Um.. Edgeworth? \ Edgeworth: What? \ Phoenix: Are you sure you didn't do it? \ Edgeworth:... \ Phoenix: (C'mon, can't he take a joke?) \ Ema: You have a strange sense of humour, Mr Wright!

[] PRESENT

[] Attorney's Badge \ Edgeworth: I once dreamed of being a defense attorney, a long time ago. \ Ema: What? You wanted to be a defense attorney, Mr Edgeworth? \ Edgeworth: Yet, my path is laid out clearly before me... \ Edgeworth: I have no time to reflect on what might have been.

[] Goodman's ID \ Phoenix: Say, Edgeworth, I was wondering about this... \ Ema: M-Mr Wright! \ Phoenix: Huh? What? \ Ema: Are you sure you should be showing that to Mr Edgeworth? \ Phoenix: Oh. (He'll take it for sure, won't he.) \ Ema: *Sigh* \ Ema: I wish I could be on the same side as Mr Edgeworth... \ Ema: But then my sister would be found guilty! \ Phoenix: (If she sighs any deeper I'm going to stgart getting depressed...)

[] Prosecutor's Trophy \ Phoenix: So, in other words, you were the best of the best this year, huh? \ Edgeworth: You can take that foolish grin elsewhere, Wright. \ Edgeworth: I lost a day orf work to receive that travesty. \ Ema: Huh? Why's that? \ Edgeworth: I had to go the Police Department ceremony to receive that broken \ shield. \ Phoenix: The Police Department? \ Edgeworth: Yes. Right next to the Police Station downtown. You've been there, \ correct? \ Phoenix: Where Detective Gumshoe works? Yeah. \ Ema: Um, I was wondering something aboujt your shield... Why is it broken? \ Edgeworth: What does it matter? I've got more important things to worry about. \ Ema: Oh. Right..... \ Phoenix: (He doesn't seem too concerned about his award, for better or for \ worse.) \ Edgeworth: Yesterday was a very busy day for the Prosecutor's Office. \ Ema: Maybe... we should ask him more about yesterday?

[] Edgeworth's Knife \ Edgeworth: It's against my policy to discuss evidence with the defence. \ Edgeworth: especially with you. \ Ema: He doesn't like you much, does he, Mr Wright? \ Phoenix: (Nah. With Edgeworth it's never personal... It's all about winning \ tomorrow)

[] TALK

[] The Day of the Crime (is now available) \ Phoenix: Could you tell me more about yesterday... the day of the murder? \ Edgeworth: Yesterday was the annual cleaning day at the Prosecutor's Office. \ Ema: Cleaning day? \ Edgeworth: Working with the Police Department, we sort and file all evidence \ for solved cases. \ Edgeworth: We call it "evidence transferal". \ Ema: Wiping your hands of old cases, in other words. \ Edgeworth: Oh, and another thing... A ceremony was held at the Police \ Department. \ Edgeworth: There's an annual review and awards for outstanding police officers \ and prosecutors., \ Phoenix: and that's when  you got the shield? \ Edgeworth: I was at the police department yesterday afternoon... I got back \ here at 5:12. \ Phoenix: That's ... very precise. \ Ema: People like myself and Mr Edgeworth pride ourselves on our precision, Mr \ Wright. \ Edgeworth: No, I place little faith in my memory. \ Edgeworth: The only thing I trust is solid evidence. \ Edgeworth's Parking Stub added to the Court Record. \ Edgeworth: This is the parking stub from the underground lot. \ Phoenix: (The murder took place aroujnd 5.15...) \ Ema: So the murder happened right after you got back. \ Edgeworth: What, Wright? \ Edgeworth: I'd appreciate it if you'd direct that suspicious glare elsewhere. \ ???: Um...! \ *An enthusiastic, keen and um, rather unrealible, officer, holding a megaphone \ appears* \ ???: Excuse me! But is Mr Edgeworth, uh... anywhere on the premises? \ Edgeworth: I'm Edgeworth. What is it? \ Officer: I'm here, sir, at the request of the Chief, sir! I've got your report, \ sir! \ Edgeworth: Report? \ Edgeworth: What? Did you find new evidence in the case against Chief Prosecutor \ kye!? \ Phoenix: (I don't like the way this conversation is going at all...) \ Officer: Er....... Skye, sir? No, sir! \ Officer: No name of that kind, sir! Not in this report, sir! \ Edgeworth: ...! \ Phoenix: (U I think I just heard Edgeworth's lid blow.) \ Ema: Mr Edgeworth's lid isn't on very tight, is it? \ Edgeworth: I made a clear request to the Police Department, did I not? \ Edgeworth: I need to focus on the trial tomorrow, so don't bring me anything \ unrelated! \ Officer: Sir! But, but sir! \ Officer: I'm just following orders, sir! They told me to bring this to you! \ Officer: (He said something that flashed pass and I (Shelley) did not catch on \ time) \ Edgeworth: Give me your name! \ Meekins: U-uh, yes... yes, Sir! M-M-Meekins, sir. Officer Meekins! \ Edgeworth: Right. Officer Meekins? Take your report and leave. \ Edgeworth: And good luck with that raise next month. \ Meekins: *whimpers* B-but, sir, I d-didn't know! \ Phoenix: (Poor guy. Looks like he was absent on the day they gave out brtains \ and good luck.) \ Edgeworth: Wright. \ Phoenix: Y-yes, sir!? (Gah! Her caught me off guard!) \ Edgeworth: As you can see, I'm busy. \ Edgeworth: You may leave now. \ Ema: L-let's do what he says, Mr Wright! \ Edgeworth: The victim was a detective from the same department as that \ patrolman jut now. \ Edgeworth: Go down to the Police Department. You can ask more there. \ Phoenix; U-uh.. Thanks. (He seems to have finally calmed down at least.)

[] Ema: Whew.... We're finally here. \ Ema: Why would they put the detectives so far away from the Prosecutor's \ Office? \ Phoenix: That took almost 30 minutes by taxi... and traffic wasn't even that \ bad. \ Phoenix: This is my first time to the Police Department, actually. ? \ Phoenix: Hold on, what's that? \ *A dancing blue cardboard cutout of... er, SOMETHING, is found in the doorway \ of Police Department.* \ Ema: Disturbing! Why does it undulate like that? \ Phoenix: Oh, wait I know. This is the "Blue Badger." \ Phoenix: They're trying to make him the police mascot. \ Ema: Wow, Mr Wright! You know a lot about the Police Department! \ Ema: Still, he does seem familiar, somehow... \ Phoenix: Forgert the Blue Badger! Who's that next to him!? \ Ema: Someone appears to be... dancing with the Blue Badger... \ Ema: Uh oh. He noticed me. \ Phoenix: He sure is running over here fast... \ *Dick Gumshoe appears* \ Gumshoe: H-h-h-hey, pal! W-w-w-what're you doin' here!? \ Phoenix: That's my line, Detective Gumshoe. \ Phoenix: Specifically, why were you dancing over there? \ Gumshoe: What!?

[] *Chose from the following: \ Examine \ Move \ Talk \ Present

[] EXAMINE

[] Banner \ Ema: The banner here is announcing the "Crime Fighting Campaign." \ Phoenix: Nice slogan... \ Ema: I wonder if they'll be selling fingerprinting sets. \ Phoenix: I don't think it's that kind of campaign. \ Ema: What family wouldn't want a set at home? \ Ema: It's good for finding out who snuck into the cookie jar. \ Phoenix: I think most families can figure that out without the extra help.

[] Police Station Sign \ Ema: I always get excited when I come to the police station. \ Phoenix: why is that? \ Ema: It just feels like I've jumped into a movie \ Phoenix: Huh? \ Ema: You know, with all the police and criminals. \ Phoenix: W-well, I don't know if this is all that exciting. \ Ema: Sure it is! Look at those two officers over there. \ Ema: They're probably talking about the latest bust! \ Phoenix: ... \ Phoenix: Funny, I thought they were talking about the weather.

[] Looking into the Police Station \ Phoenix: The detectives in there look pretty busy. \ Ema: Just imagine! Right now... \ Ema:Behind those doors... A police drama in action! \ Phoenix: ... \ Phoenix: (Somehow the thought fails to excite me...)

[] Notice Boards \ Phoenix: The usual wanted posters are hanging up on the bulletin board here. \ Phoenix: <<Do you know this face!? if you do, dial 911!>> \ Ema: You know, Mr Wright, I've always thought it was kind of funny... \ Ema: I've never seen anyone who looked like the people in these posters. \ Ema: They hardly even look human! \ Phoenix:... \ Phoenix: (She has a point...)

[] Blue Badger \ Ema: Uh, I was wondering about that... \ Gumshoe: What? The Dancing Blue Badger? It's my masterpiece! \ Phoenix: You made this, Detective Gumshoe? \ Gumshoe: The chief threw together some designs and I just did my thing, pal. \ Ema: N-nice work... \ Gumshoe: It's battery-powered, so it can go anywhere! \ Gumshoe: There's no switch, so it just dance dance dances until the batteries \ die! \ Ema: Poor Blue Badger... fated to dance until he drops. \ Blue Badger added to the Court Record.

[] Two Policemen Standing on Front of the Station \ Phoenix: Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a \ detective. \ Police: And then I said "hey, you do that, your soup will get cold, buddy." \ Patrolman: Th-that's hilarious, sir! I laughed so hard I cried! \ Ema: ... \ Ema: I guess he wasn't saluting, he was wiping tears from his eyes. \ Phoenix: They make a good pair.

[] Police Car \ Ema: Mr Wright! Do you know why patrol cars are painted black and white? \ Phoenix: No idea. Why? \ Ema; Well, I think they're designed after a panda! \ Phoenix: A panda...? \ Ema: Not that I have scientific proof. It's just a theory. \ Phoenix: Um... do you mind me asking how you came up with that theory? \ Ema: It was when I was on a school trip! I saw a patrol car and it came to me! \ Ema: We had just been at the zoo, see... \ Phoenix: ... \ Phoenix: What about zebras? Or did they not have those at your zoo?

[] TALK

[] The Case \ Gumshoe: I'll give you one word of advice, pal. \ Gumshoe: You'd better not agree to defend the suspect in this case. \ Ema: Wh... Why not? \ Gumshoe: Huh? \ Gumshoe: Well... It's just that the Chief Prosecutor has confessed to the \ crime. \ Gumshoe: She says she summoned the dtective to the Prosecutor's Office and... \ She killed him. \ Ema: But, what if she's not telling the truth!? \ Gumshoe: Yes, well... no! C'mon, pal! There's plenty of evidence against her! \ Ema: B-but what if the evidence was faked? \ Gumshoe: Hey, pal. Can I speak to you for a second? \ Phoenix: Huh? Me? \ Gumshoe: Why is this little girl so peeved at me? \ Phoenix: She's a relative of the suspect. Lana Skye's sister. \ Gumshoe: Whoa!! The Chief Prosecutor's little sister!? \ Ema: Just, please investigate this case carefully, okay? Scientifically! \ Gumshoe: Yessir! Oh, by the way. \ Gumshoe: You might want to keep your voices down. \ Gumshoe: YOu don't want to be overheard using words like "faked"... \ Ema: Huh? \ Gumshoe: It's just... It's a sensitive issue with us these days.

[] The Investigation \ Ema: So... what are you doing here, Detective Gumshoe? \ Gumshoe: Me? Oh, well, nothing, really. \ Gumshoe: They kicked me out of Criminal Affairs... \ Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! What did you do this time? \ Gumshoe: Whaddya you, "this time"!? \ Ema: Then, what happened? \ Ema: I know things are busy right now... \ Ema: I mean... with my sister's case and all... \ Gumshoe: It's true. We've never had a Chief Prosecutor murder anyone before! \ Gumshoe: Only the highest-ranked people are being let into Criminal Affairs \ now. \ Gumshoe: The lowest ranking guy in there is our chief of detectives. \ Gumshoe: They're not letting any of us ranking-and-file detectives in at all. \ Ema: None of you? \ Phoenix: (I know this is an important trial, but isdn't that a little odd?) \ Gumshoe: So, anyway, I thought I'd spend the day getting the badger dance down \ pat. \ Ema: Um... Isn't there anything else you could be doing? \ Gumshoe: The Chief of Police himself is directing this investigation, pal. \ Gumshoe: And Officer Marshall was assigned to the underground parking lot. \ Ema: Officer Marshall... \ Phoenix: (Now that i think about it, Ema did seem to know that Marshall guy.) \ Gumshoe: A patrolman in charge of a crime scene... It's unheard of, pal!

[] PRESENT

[] Attorney's Badge \ Phoenix: Detective... here's my attorney's badge. \ Gumshoe: You show this to me everytime we meet, pal. \ Gumshoe: real men show their police badge. 'Nuff said! \ Ema: I wish I had a badge... Even an ID card would be nice... \ Phoenix: (Wait...) \ Phoenix: (Speaking of ID cards, I found that detective's card, didn't I...?)

[] Goodman's ID \ Phoenix: Um, Detective Gumshoe? What can you tell me about this? \ Gumshow: Huh? Hey, pal! This is a detective's ID card! \ Gumshoe: YOu can't just keep that! You have to turn it in to the police! \ Gumshoe: It's people like you that get me into so much trouble all the time! \ Phoenix: (Meaning Detective Gumshoe must drop his card a lot.) \ Gumshoe: Hmmm... Let's see... "Bruce Goodman"... \ Gumshoe: Goodman... Sounds familiar... \ Gumshoe: ... Nah, my mistake. \ Ema: But, don't you work together with him in Criminal Affairs? \ Gumshoe *suddenly interrupts): Whoa!! Now I remember! \ Gumshoe: Bruce Goodman! He's the victim! \ Phoenix: (That's what I thought...) \ Ema: Can you tell us more, Detective Gumshoe?

[] Prosecutor's Trophy \ Gumshoe: Hey, that's it! \ Gumshoe: That's the "King of Prosecutors" award that Mr Edgeworth got \ yesterday! \ Phoenix: Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe? \ Gumshoe: Of course, pal! I got an award for dilligence, myself. \ Phoenix: Ah... congratulations. \ Ema: I was wondering, why is the award a shield? \ Ema: And... Why is it broken? \ Gumshoe: Oh, there's a reason. \ Gumshoe: Um... I'll tell you what it is later. \ Phoenix: (Appearantly, he's forgotten.) \ Gumshoe: But, I was proud of Mr Edgeworth for winning that award. \ Gumshoe: He's even got naysayers in the Prosecutor's Office. \ Phoenix: (Yeah, we've heard about the rumours...)

[] Edgeworth's Knife \ Gumshoe: Found in Mr Edgeworth's car, stabbed with Mr Edgeworth's knife, huh... \ Gumshoe: What would drive Chief Proseutor Skye to do such a thing? \ Ema: ... \ Gumshoe: W-wait, I didn't mean... I mean, sure, of course someone else really \ did it! \ Gumshoe: Someone who must have, um... \ Gumshoe: Someone who must have a grudge against Mr Edgeworth. \ Phoenix: (The car and the knife do seem a little too well-organised to be a \ coincidence.) \ Ema: Poor Mr Edgeworth... What could have happened? \ Phoenix: (We have to find out a little more about what's going on with \ Edgeworth...)

[] Parking Stub \ Gumshoe: Found in Mr Edgeworth's car, stabbed with Mr Edgeworth's knife, huh... \ Gumshoe: What would drive Chief Proseutor Skye to do such a thing? \ Ema: ... \ Gumshoe: W-wait, I didn't mean... I mean, sure, of course someone else really \ did it! \ Gumshoe: Someone who must have, um... \ Gumshoe: Someone who must have a grudge against Mr Edgeworth. \ Phoenix: (The car and the knife do seem a little too well-organised to be a \ coincidence.) \ Ema: Poor Mr Edgeworth... What could have happened? \ Phoenix: (We have to find out a little more about what's going on with \ Edgeworth...)

[] Blue Badger \ Gumshoe: As a detective, I have to keep my mouth shut on that one. \ Gumshoe: I know better than to go blabbing on about things I don't know \ about... \ Phoenix: No, I wouldn't want you to do that either... \ Gumshoe: Good.

[] Letter of Introduction \ Gumshoe: As a detective, I have to keep my mouth shut on that one. \ Gumshoe: I know better than to go blabbing on about things I don't know \ about... \ Phoenix: No, I wouldn't want you to do that either... \ Gumshoe: Good.

[] TALK (New informations added)

[] Bruce Goodman \ Phoenix: So... this ID card belonged to the victim? \ Gumshoe: He was a detective, like myself. \ Gumshoe: Detective Bruce Goodman. \ Ema: Hmm... Don't you think it's strange? \ Ema: I mean, why would the victim's ID card be lying on the ground where we \ found it? \ Gumshoe: Well, Detective Goodman should have been at the Police Department \ yesterday. \ Gumshoe: There was an evidence transferal for a case he handled two years ago. \ Ema: Evidence transferal... Mr Edgeworth mentioned that too. \ Ema: But... Detective Goodman was killed at the Prosecutor's Office. \ Gumshoe: Well, that's the thing... It's hard to say this, but... \ Gumshoe: Word is that Chief Prosecutor Skye called him out there, to the \ parking lot. \ Phoenix: (And Lana's confessing as much...)

[] Rumours at Law \ Gumshoe: He's in a tough spot, again... \ Phoenix: "again"...? \ *Scene of the Goud Lake murder flashes back to Phoenix's mind* \ Gumshoe: Well, it all started with the murder of that defense attorney, \ Hammond. \ Ema: But Edgeworth was found innocent! \ Gumshoe: Listen, pal, there have always been rumours about Edgeworth. \ Gumshoe: Forging evidence, making deals with witnesses... \ Gumshoe: Nothing outright, but there were always whispered rumours. \ Gumshoe: Ever since he was accused of murder, no one's whispering. They are \ practically shouting. \ Ema: But... but there's no evidence against him! \ Gumshoe: Well, Mr Edgeworth has always had unusually strong ties to the \ department higher-ups. \ Gumshoe: It's only natural that people would be suspicious. \ Phoenix: (I had no idea he was under the gun...) \ Gumshoe: Anyway, this latest case has started a new rumour. \ Gumshoe: People say the only reason he took this case... \ Gumshoe: Is because he's aiming for the Chief Prosecutor position himself! \ Phoenix: W-what!? \ Gumshoe: But I know the truth, pal! \ Gumshoe: Nobody wants to be the one who has to prosecute the chief prosecutor! \ Gumshoe: Mr Edgeworth is  biting the bullet on this one! He's doing this for \ all of us! \ Gumshoe: ... \ Gumshoe: And that's all I know about that. \ Gumshoe: I'm not officially on this case, you know. \ Ema: Thank you! \ Phoenix: Why aren't you handling the case, Detective Gumshoe? \ Phoenix: We met the guy who is... what was his name? The guy in the parking \ lot... \ Gumshoe: That'd be Officer Marshall. \ Gumshoe: He was appointed directily by the Chief of Police... \ Phoenix: Officer Marshall... Is he some kind of Wild West sheriff or something? \ Gumshoe: No, Jake Marshall's just a regular officer... \ Gumshoe: From West LA. \ Phoenix: For a moment there, I wasn't sure. \ Gumshoe: Look, pal, let me try to make things a little easier for you. \ Gumshoe: Show them this and they'll let you examine the crime scene... maybe. \ Letter of Introduction from Detective Gumshoe added to the Court Record. \ Phoenix: (I'll be surprised if this gets us anywhere...) \ Gumshoe: Just act like you're suppose to be there, and no bdy will look at you \ twice, pal!

Looks like I'll be stuck in this pit 'til the sun sleeps. \ ???: I'll see you in my dreams tonight, then, baby. \ Angel: Oh! Still here? \ Ema: Ah, h-hello! \ Angel: Why the surprised looks? Didn't I mention...? \ Angel: I've got a boyfriend in Criminal Affairs, too. \ Phoenix: (What happened to the security guard?!) \ Marshall: Hey! What's wrong, bambina? \ Marshall: YOu're lookin' like a dogie that's lost its herd! \ Phoenix: (Jake Marshall...) \ Phoenix: (Strange guy to put in charge of a crime scene.)

[] The Victim \ Ema: There's something I wanted to ask you! \ Marshall: The scene of crime... a cold grave for men who've lost their \ dreams... \ Marshall: And me? I watch over them as they sleep... Dreaming of the desert's \ harsh judgement. \ Marshall: ... \ Ema: He's asleep. \ Phoenix: Well... should we show this hopeless case something to catch his \ interest?

[] PRESENT

[] Attorney's Badge \ Phoenix: Officer Marshall? Could you take a look at this? \ Marshall: Whoa, pardner! \ Marshall: If you're fixing to draw on me, you best be ready for a shootout! \ Marshall: You ready to become food for the vultures, compadre? \ Ema: Are you ready, Mr Wright? \ Phoenix: (Somehow I don't think he's going to help us.)

[] Blue Badger \ Marshall: Alright compadre! Count to three! \ Phoenix: Huh? \ Marshall: You gotta do that if you're going to draw evidence on someone. \ Marshall: That's what we do in Texas. \ Phoenix: Rmeind me never to visit Texas.

[] Letter of Introduction \ Phoenix: Would you mind reading this for me? \ Marshall: What's this? I warn you, fan letters to me go right into the \ spittoon! \ Phoenix: It's a latter of introduction from detective Gumshoe. May be \ investigate? \ Marshall: Gumshoe...? Ah, that old cowdog? \ Marshall: Hmm... He holding a birthday party or something? \ Phoenix: Huh? \ Marshall: Look, where it should say letter of "introduction"... It says \ "invitation." \ Phoenix: Ah... I think he just miswrote it. \ Phoenix: (Great, Detective Gumshoe. I owe you one...) \ Marshall: No worries. This proves it's from Detective Gumshoe, better than a \ blood test. \ Marshall: Guess I'd better let you in, then. \ Ema: Th-thank you, Officer Marshall! \ Phoenix: (Officer Marshall isn't a "detective"... He's a "patrolman"...) \ Phoenix: (That reminds me of something...) \ Ema: That is odd! \ Ema: Isn't a crime scene suppose to be handled by a detecive or higher? \ Marshall: Well, folks. \ Marshall: The clues are calling! Welcome to our gold strike. \ Marshall: Be like the settler! Strike out for lands unknown! \ Marshall: Manifest Destiny! Let's have a hootenanny! \ Ema: Note to self: police investigations are like settling land. \ Ema: Well, Mr Wright, what do you say!? \ Phoenix: (I say I won't be needing this anymore) \ Detective Gumshoe's Letter of Introduction crumpled and discarded.

[] PRESENT

[] Attorney's Badge \ Marshall: I see your badge. Looks pretty... round. \ Marshall: Our badge is a star, a lone star, shining in the nightime sky. \ Marshall: A beam of light, illuminating evildoers who come in the dark of \ night! \ Ema: Note to self: Evildoers are weak against starlight. \ Phoenix: (Hey, that's a sheriff's badge!)

[] Goodman's ID \ Marshall: What's that? Some sort of police passport? \ Phoenix: This is Detective Goodman's ID card. Strangely Enough... \ Phoenix: We found it a good distance away from the crime scene. \ Marshall: Good distance, in this rat hole? if you want distance, get yourself \ to Texas! \ Ema: Texas... \ Marshall: This is a tiny little crime scene, in a tiny little town, with tiny \ little evidence. \ Marshall: What difference does a few yards make, compadre? \ Ema: Note to self: if you encounter suspicious evidence, think of Texas. \ Ema: There's no better way to study than to hang out with the pros!

[] Prosecutor's Trophy \ Marshall: Ah, a toy shield! Suits the boy well. \ Marshall: What exactly could you shield with that? A toy knight, maybe? \ Ema: Officer Marshall, don't you have anything good to say about Mr Edgeworth? \ Phoenix: You don't like him, right? We get the point. \ Marshall: You know, when I was a detective, I got one of those... \ Ema: Hmmm... Let me guess... Did it have a "K" for "King of Detectives" on it? \ Phoenix: Hey, they could use the same shielf over and over. \ Ema: Note to self: the Prosecutor Office and Criminal Affairs are surprisingly \ cheap. \ Marshall: You know it! They've gotten cheaper with every passing year, I tell \ you.

[] Edgeworth's Kinfe \ Marshall: Alright compadre! Count to three! \ Phoenix: Huh? \ Marshall: You gotta do that if you're going to draw evidence on someone. \ Marshall: That's what we do in Texas. \ Phoenix: Rmeind me never to visit Texas.

[] Parking Stub \ Marshall: 5:12 PM... \ Marshall: The prosecutor's bright red steed came in at a trot, real show like. \ Ema: A... trot? \ Marshall: My Madonna tells me the crime occerred three minutes later... \ Marshall: So it seems the Chief Prospector was lying in wait! \ Marshall: Maybe... waiting for her prince to ride in on his bright red horse... \ Phoenix: (So what you mean is...) \ Phoenix: (The killer intended to use Edgeworth's car all along!)

[] Blue Badger \ Marshall: Alright compadre! Count to three! \ Phoenix: Huh? \ Marshall: You gotta do that if you're going to draw evidence on someone. \ Marshall: That's what we do in Texas. \ Phoenix: Rmeind me never to visit Texas.

[] TALK

[] The Victim \ Phoenix: Officer Marshall? Could you tell us more about the victim? \ Marshall: ... \ Marshall: Good men always die young. Remember that, pardner. \ Phoenix: Um... could you be a little more specific? \ Ema: Bruce Goodman... He was a detective, right? \ Marshall: Well, well, aren't you a feisty dogie there now. \ Marshall: Detective Goodman was stabbed here at 5:15. \ Marshall: The smiling Madonna told me the tale... \ Phoenix: (I think he means the witness, Ms. Angel Starr.) \ Marshall: One stab to the chest. A fine piece of work. \ Marshall: This here's the autopsy report. \ Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. \ Ema: Was my sister involved with the victim in any way? \ Marshall: Funny you should mention that, Bambina. \ Marshall: Chief Prosepector Skye and Detective Goodman... had nothing in common \ t all. \ Ema: Nothing in common...? \ Marshall: They appearently worked together on a case a few years back. \ Phoenix: (So... There's not motive!) \ Marshall: Goodman wasn't a particularly gifted detective. \ Marshall: That's one reason why he didn't do much work with the Chief \ Prospector... \ Ema: But, my sister called the victim here on the day of the murder, right? \ Ema: Here... to this parking lot? \ Marshall: So it seems. Like callinhg an unarmed man to a shootout at high noon.

[] Marshall \ Phoenix: Um, I don't mean any offense, but... \ Phoenix: Officer Marshall, you're a patrolman, right? Not a detective. \ Marshall: You calling' me out? They shoot you for that in Texas. \ Phoenix: Huh? \ Marshall: I was one of them fancy-shoed "Detectives" till two years ago, to \ tell ya the truth. \ Phoenix: Oh, really? (Now he tells me!) \ Ema: But you're a patrolman now. So how can you be in charge of a crime scene? \ Marshall: Nothing gets by you, does it, bambina? \ Phoenix: So, why are you in charge? \ Marshall: No reason. We're just short on hands right now. I'm keeping an eye \ out in the meantime. \ Ema: That's odd, though. \ Ema: Detective Gumshoe was saying he had nothing to do... nothing important, at \ least. \ Marshall: He's nothing but a sad ol' cowdog, that can't find his tail. \ Marshall: Maybe it's because he runs with that Edgeworth, eh? \ Phoenix: Edgeworth...? \ Marshall: That cowdog's been kicked out of this cattle run... by order of the \ Chief of Police. \ Marshall: Just, he don't realize it yet. \ Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe, kicked out of the investigation?!)

[] EXAMINE (The other side of the crime scene)

[] Letter on the Wall \ Ema: "A Block"... This area is reserved for the prosecutors. \ Phoenix: Defense attorneys are relegated to "B Block." \ Ema: I dream of the day when I will be able to park my car here! \ Ema: I'll go over to B Block to buy my hamburgers from you, Mr Wright. \ Phoenix: I'm not planning on giving up my job that soon...

[] Cellphone on the Floor \ Phoenix: This looks like a cell phone. \ Ema: Scientifically analysis would suggest this belonged to the victim! \ Ema: In can't think of anyone else it could belong to... \ Phoenix: (What's so scientific about that!?) Should we check it out? \ Select your answer: Check it out, Forget it. \ Check it out: \ Phoenix: (Right! Let's check it out.) \ Phoenix pressed the side blue button on the phone. \ Ema: Hmm. The display is still on the redial button. \ Phoenix: Redial...? \ Ema: Um,Mr Wright? \ Ema: Most phones keep a record of all the calls you've made and received. \ Ema: You jujst press the blue button to dial the last number you called. \ Ema: Convenient, isn't it? I'm surprised you didn't know about it. \ Phoenix: Sorry to disppoint you, but even I know about things like "redial". \ Ema: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry! \ Ema: It's just, you never know with people from your generation. \ Phoenix: (Whatever... Let's check this phone out.) \ Phoenix checked the phone strap \ Ema: Man, what a boring strap! \ Phoenix: What's wrong with it? Everyone has different tastes, you know. \ Ema: Here, check out mine. It's a Pink Princess Strap! \ Ema: These are hard to come by, you know. \ Phoenix: (I see he's as popular as ever with the kids...) \ Phoenix pressed the redial button. \ Phoenix: (Now, I wonder who the owner of this phone called last...) \ Ema: Note to self: A defense attorney doesn't think first, he just pushes the \ button. \ Cellular: *beep* \ Cellular: ... *A familiar theme plays* \ Phoenix: Hey! That song! I know that! \ Marshall: Hey! What's going on over there? \ Cellular: *beep* \ Phoenix: Ah! Oh, s-sorry! \ Marshall: I see you, pardner! \ Marshall: You pressed redial on that there phone, didn't you? \ Phoenix: Uh, well, yeah... \ Ema: Whose phone is this, anyway? It ws on the ground over there... \ Marshall: Whose is it? That belongs to the Chief Prospector, Skye. \ Ema: What? It's my sister's!? \ Marshall: She apparently dropped it when she was taken into custody, right \ aftger the crime. \ Marshall: Look... the last call was made right when the murder occurred! \ Marshall: Looks like she was fixing to call someone. \ Marshall: Except she only spoke for a few seconds, according to this. \ Phoenix: Who did she call!? \ Marshall: No idea. Sorry, pardner. \ Marshall: Now, I got a question for you, pardner. \ Marshall: I heard a phone ring just now... one of those new-fangled ring-tunes. \ Phoenix: Oh? That? Oh.,.. I'm sorry, that was my phone. \ Marshall: W-w-what? Your phone? \ Phoenix: Yeah, uh, it's kind of strange, but... \ Phoenix: Someone called me right as we picked up the other phone, a wrong \ number... \ Marshall: ... \ Marshall: I hope you're not lying... They shoot you for that in Texas, pardner! \ Phoenix: Uh oh, I've incited the wrath of the Lone Star patrolman...) \ Cell Phone added to the Court Record. \ Forget it: \ On the second thought, let's not. \ Ema: What!? Why not? I mean, don't you want to know whose it is? \ Phoenix: Probably one of the Detectives dropped it. \ Ema: Come on! No detective would be that dumb! \ *Image of Dick Gumshoe flashed on front of Phoenix* \ Phoenix: (I don't know. One detective in particular comes to mind.)

[] Fence \ Phoenix: "B Block" is through there. That's where visitors park. \ Ema: I can see the Lunchland car over there... far in the distance. \ Phoenix: Hey, you're right. I like the cute design on the door. \ Phoenix: (I can see... a cartoon cow munching down on a juicy looking steak.) \ Ema: ... \ Ema: Doesn't that strike you as a little... creepy?) \ Phoenix: Just odn't think too deeply about it and you'll be fine.

[] Car \ Phoenix: This appears to be ther car where the body was found. \ Phoenix: (It looks like the lock on the trunk is busted) \ *flashback* \ Lana: The crime took place in the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's \ Office. \ Lana: The body was found in the trunk of my subordinate's car. \ *end of flashback* \ Ema: Quite a luxury car. It just screams "I have money to burn." \ Phoenix: Yeah. Prosecutors get the big bucks.

[] Rope Around the Body \ Ema: This rope... is it...? \ Phoenix: Yup. They laid it in the outline of the victim's body. \ Ema: ... \ Ema: So wait... The victim must have died when the killer closed the trunk on \ him! \ Phoenix: ... \ Phoenix: (You have got to be the only person I know that would come to that \ conclusion.)

[] Lid of the Car Trunk \ Phoenix: What's this? Looks like a note of some sort. \ Ema: Look!Something's written on it! \ *A note with "6-75, 12/2" written on a piece of paper with "Goodman" printed on \ top right hand corner is shown* \ Phoenix: You're right. Let's see... "6-7S, 12/2"... \ Ema: There's a name printed on the paper above that... "Goodman." \ Phoenix: (Maybe it fell out of his pocket when he was killed.) \ Ema: Well? So? What does it mean, Mr Wright? \ Phoenix: How am I supposed to know? \ Ema: Note to self: For deductive reasoning, go to Edgeworth, not Wright. \ Phoenix: (I'm sure Edgeworth wouldn't know what this means either.) \ Goodman's Note added to the Court Record.

[] TALK (new options are available

[] Lana Skye \ Ema: So, there's no connection between Detective Goodman and my sister! \ Marshall: THat's correct, but... \ Marshall: There's a goldmine of evidence against her... \ Phoenix: ...! \ Marshall: And the prospector tomorrow is none other than Edgeworth himself... \ Marshall: I'm afraid your sister's fate is decided, bambina. Many condolences. \ Ema: Officer Marshall! \ Marshall: Yeah, bambina? \ Ema: H-how can you say that! \ Ema: You and my sister, you were... \ Phoenix: (Is there something  between this cop and her sister that I don't know \ about?) \ Marshall: ...! \ Marshall: I apologize, bambina. Something must have gotten to me. \ Marshall: Maybe it's that dry wind that's a-blowin' through the Prospector's \ Office. \ Phoenix: (Dry wind or ill will, someone's up to something here... but who?)

[] Office atmosphere \ Marshall: Suspicious about Mr Edgeworth have been flying around for nearly two \ years now. \ Phoenix: Forged evidence... arranging testimonies, you name it. \ Marshall: He was unbeatable because he did whatever it took to win. \ Marshall: Unbeatable that is, until he met you. \ Ema: But rumours are just... rumours, aren't they? \ Ema: These are prosecutors we're talking about! Evidence is everything to them! \ Marshall: If you follow the rumours about Edgeworth to their source, you find \ one person... \ Marshall: But... they're off limits. Untouchable, you might say. \ Phoenix: One person? Who? \ Marshall: Bambina... It's your sister. Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye. \ Ema: What!? My sister...? \ Marshall: Edgeworth couldn't rustle all those cattle by himself. \ Marshall: Some people load their guns with bullets, some people load them with \ "deals". \ Phoenix: What, you're saying Edgeworth was making deals to win trials? \ Marshall: "Where there's gunshots, there's bound to be bullets." \ Marshall: That's what the old-timers say. \ Marshall: There's a big ol' secret hidden around here somewhere. Everyone knows \ it. \ Phoenix: (Is that why Detective Gumshoe was taken off the case....?) \ Phoenix: (Did they target him because he was closest to Edgeworth?)

[] PRESENT (new informations are added)

[] Goodman's Autopsy Report \ Marshall: Alright compadre! Count to three! \ Phoenix: Huh? \ Marshall: You gotta do that if you're going to draw evidence on someone. \ Marshall: That's what we do in Texas. \ Phoenix: Rmeind me never to visit Texas.
